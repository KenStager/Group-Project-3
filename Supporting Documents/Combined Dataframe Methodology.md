The combined CSV file, combined_comparative_results.csv, represents a comprehensive consolidation of various text comparison metrics derived from different sources and models. Here’s an exhaustive description of the contents and how it compiles the previous six dataframes into one useful dataframe:
Types of Files
1. Raw Texts: Full texts extracted from arXiv papers.
2. Summaries: Concise summaries written from the abstract of each paper.
3. 3.5T Blog: Blog posts generated using GPT-3.5 Turbo, based on the summaries.
4. 4o Blog: Blog posts generated using GPT-4o, based on the summaries.
5. 4o Blog Raw Text: Blog posts generated using GPT-4o, based on the raw texts.
Comparisons Made
The dataframe compiles the comparison metrics from the following specific comparisons:
1. GPT-4o Blog from summaries vs. GPT-4o Blog from raw text (comparison_results_4o_Sum_to_4o_Raw.csv).
2. GPT-3.5 Turbo Blog vs. GPT-4o Blog from summaries (comparison_results_35blog_sum_to_4oblog_sum.csv).
3. Raw text vs. GPT-4o Blog from raw text (comparison_results_raw_to_4o.csv).
4. Summaries vs. GPT-3.5 Turbo Blog from summaries (comparison_results_sum_to_3.5.csv).
5. Summaries vs. GPT-4o Blog from summaries (comparison_results_sum_to_4o_blog.csv).
6. Raw texts vs. generated summaries (comparison_results_sum_to_raw.csv).
Data Columns
Each row in the dataframe corresponds to a comparison between two files, and the columns capture various metrics related to these comparisons:
1. summary_file: The filename of the first text file in the comparison (can be raw text, summary, or blog post).
2. raw_file: The filename of the second text file in the comparison (can be raw text, summary, or blog post).
3. exact_match_ratio: The ratio of exact word matches between the two texts.
4. cosine_similarity: The cosine similarity score between the two texts, representing the textual similarity based on TF-IDF vectors.
5. topic_overlap: The overlap in topics between the two texts, determined using topic modeling.
6. key_phrase_overlap: The overlap in key phrases between the two texts.
7. semantic_similarity: The semantic similarity between the two texts, computed using BERT embeddings.
8. readability_summary: The readability score of the first text (where applicable).
9. readability_raw: The readability score of the second text (where applicable).
10. sentence_length_summary: The average sentence length of the first text (where applicable).
11. sentence_length_raw: The average sentence length of the second text (where applicable).
12. readability_difference: The difference in readability scores between the two texts.
13. sentence_length_difference: The difference in average sentence lengths between the two texts.
Column Mapping for Each Comparison Type
For each comparison type, specific columns capture the readability and sentence length metrics:
1. 35 Blog from Summary to 4o Blog from Summary:
   1. Readability Columns: readability_35t, readability_4o
   2. Sentence Length Columns: sentence_length_35t, sentence_length_4o
2. Raw Text to 4o Blog:
   1. Readability Columns: readability_raw, readability_blog
   2. Sentence Length Columns: sentence_length_raw, sentence_length_blog
3. Summary to 35 Blog:
   1. Readability Columns: readability_summary, readability_blog
   2. Sentence Length Columns: sentence_length_summary, sentence_length_blog
4. Summary to 4o Blog:
   1. Readability Columns: readability_summary, readability_blog
   2. Sentence Length Columns: sentence_length_summary, sentence_length_blog
Ensuring No Missing Data
The script ensures that the readability_difference and sentence_length_difference columns are calculated for all relevant rows by performing the following steps:
1. Identifying the relevant comparison types.
2. Calculating the differences based on the corresponding readability and sentence length columns for each comparison type.
3. Filling any missing values in the readability_difference and sentence_length_difference columns.
Output
The final output is a consolidated dataframe with all the necessary metrics for each pair of compared texts, ensuring that no values are missing for the readability_difference and sentence_length_difference columns.


This comprehensive dataframe allows for a detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between various text types and their generated blog posts, enabling insights into the quality and characteristics of the generated content.
