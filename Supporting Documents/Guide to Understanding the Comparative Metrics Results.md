Guide to Understanding the Comparative Metrics Results
This guide explains the various metrics presented in the comparative metrics results for different text comparisons. Each metric provides insight into the similarities and differences between two types of texts.
Comparison Type
* comparison_type: This column indicates the type of comparison made between different texts. It shows which pairs of text types were compared, such as summaries, raw texts, and blogs generated by different models.
Exact Match Ratio
* exact_match_ratio: This metric represents the proportion of words in the first text that exactly match words in the second text. A higher exact match ratio indicates a greater number of identical words between the two texts.
Cosine Similarity
* cosine_similarity: Cosine similarity measures the textual similarity between two documents based on their TF-IDF vectors. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 means the texts are identical, 0 means they are completely dissimilar, and -1 indicates they are opposites.
Topic Overlap
* topic_overlap: This metric indicates the extent to which the main topics covered by the two texts overlap. It is derived from topic modeling techniques and is expressed as a proportion. A higher value means more topics are shared between the texts.
Key Phrase Overlap
* key_phrase_overlap: Key phrase overlap measures the similarity of key phrases between the two texts. It is the proportion of key phrases in the first text that appear in the second text. A higher value indicates greater overlap in important phrases.
Semantic Similarity
* semantic_similarity: This metric measures the semantic similarity between the two texts using BERT embeddings. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the texts have identical meanings and 0 indicates no semantic similarity.
Readability Difference
* readability_difference: Readability difference represents the difference in readability scores between the two texts. It is calculated by subtracting the readability score of the second text from the readability score of the first text. A positive value means the first text is more readable, while a negative value indicates the second text is more readable.
Sentence Length Difference
* sentence_length_difference: This metric represents the difference in average sentence lengths between the two texts. It is calculated by subtracting the average sentence length of the second text from the average sentence length of the first text. A positive value means the first text has longer sentences on average, while a negative value indicates the second text has longer sentences.
How to Use This Guide
1. Identify the Comparison Type: Start by looking at the comparison_type to understand which pairs of texts are being compared.
2. Evaluate Exact Word Matches: Check the exact_match_ratio to see how many words are identical between the texts.
3. Assess Overall Similarity: Look at the cosine_similarity to gauge the overall similarity of the texts based on word usage.
4. Understand Topic Coverage: Refer to the topic_overlap to understand how much the main topics of the texts overlap.
5. Analyze Key Phrase Similarity: Use the key_phrase_overlap to see how similar the key phrases are between the texts.
6. Check Semantic Similarity: Look at the semantic_similarity to evaluate how similar the meanings of the texts are.
7. Compare Readability: Assess the readability_difference to see which text is more readable.
8. Compare Sentence Lengths: Check the sentence_length_difference to understand the difference in sentence lengths between the texts.


This guide helps users interpret the comparative metrics and understand the various aspects of textual similarity and difference between different types of texts.
