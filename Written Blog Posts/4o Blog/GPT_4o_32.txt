# The IKEA Effect: Building Empathy for Agents in Human-Robot Relationships

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of human-robot interactions, where machines and artificial intelligence continue to integrate seamlessly into our daily lives, fostering acceptance and cooperation between humans and artificial agents becomes crucial. One of the key elements to achieving this is empathy. Recent research by Takahiro Tsumura and Seiji Yamada delves into the intriguing phenomenon known as the IKEA effect and its potential to promote empathy towards agents. This study sheds light on how humans perceive and interact with anthropomorphic agents, ultimately impacting our social coexistence with robots. In this blog post, we will explore the findings of this research and discuss its profound implications for the future of human-robot relationships.

## The IKEA Effect and Empathy

The IKEA effect is a psychological phenomenon where people place higher value on products they partially created. Named after the Swedish furniture giant IKEA, which requires customers to assemble their own purchases, this effect suggests that our effort and involvement in creating something fosters a deeper connection and appreciation for it. Tsumura and Yamada's study investigated whether this effect could extend to artificial agents, such as robots and virtual assistants.

### Key Findings

The researchers conducted experiments to explore if the act of creating an agent, akin to assembling IKEA furniture, could influence human empathy towards these artificial entities. The results were surprising and insightful. They found that the process of building an agent can indeed foster empathy towards it, regardless of the participants' pre-existing relationships with the agents. This indicates that personal involvement in creating an agent significantly impacts human perceptions and emotions towards these non-human entities.

Interestingly, the study also revealed that there was no significant difference in empathy levels among participants before and after the task. This suggests that the creation process itself plays a pivotal role in enhancing empathy towards the agent. The act of assembly, involving personal effort and time, appears to cultivate a sense of attachment and empathy towards the agent.

### Implications

The implications of this research are profound and far-reaching. By leveraging the IKEA effect, designers and engineers can potentially design interactive systems that actively involve users in the creation and customization of artificial agents. This involvement can foster a sense of empathy and attachment towards these entities, making them more acceptable and integrated into human society.

For instance, in healthcare settings, patients could be involved in customizing their robotic assistants, which could lead to better acceptance and more effective care. In educational environments, students could participate in building educational robots, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement with the learning process.

Understanding the mechanisms behind empathy promotion in human-robot interactions can lead to the development of more socially intelligent agents. These agents can effectively engage with humans on an emotional level, enhancing their acceptance and integration into various societal settings. Imagine a classroom where students feel an emotional connection to their educational robots, or a hospital where patients trust and rely on their robotic caregivers.

## Conclusion

The study by Tsumura and Yamada underscores the importance of empathy in shaping human perceptions of artificial agents. It highlights the transformative potential of the IKEA effect in promoting empathy in human-robot relationships. By exploring innovative approaches to enhance empathy towards agents, we can pave the way for a more harmonious coexistence between humans and robots in our increasingly interconnected world of technology and AI.

As we move forward, it is essential to remember that empathy is not just a human trait to be emulated by robots but a critical component of our interactions with these artificial entities. By fostering empathy through involvement and personalization, we can create a future where humans and robots coexist more harmoniously, enhancing the quality of life and the efficiency of various societal functions.
