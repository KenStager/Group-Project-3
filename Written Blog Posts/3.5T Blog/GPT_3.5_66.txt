**Directed Labeled Heterogeneous Agent Graph Representation:**
The study introduces a revolutionary concept of representing multi-agent communication through a directed labeled heterogeneous agent graph. In this innovative framework, nodes symbolize distinct agent classes, while the edge labels indicate the nature of communication between different classes of agents. This sophisticated graph-based representation allows researchers to craft a neural network architecture that specializes in facilitating communication in heterogeneous multi-agent environments. By visualizing communication pathways in this structured manner, agents can efficiently exchange information and coordinate actions with precision.

**Tailored Communication Strategies for Fully Cooperative Tasks:**
A pivotal contribution of this research is the focus on tailored communication strategies designed explicitly for fully cooperative tasks. By integrating agent class information into the communication process, the proposed approach empowers agents to exchange information effectively and synchronize actions more efficiently. This targeted communication strategy not only boosts the overall performance of multi-agent systems but also fosters a deeper level of collaboration among diverse agents. The ability to tailor communication strategies based on the specific characteristics of agents enhances adaptability and optimizes outcomes in complex scenarios.
