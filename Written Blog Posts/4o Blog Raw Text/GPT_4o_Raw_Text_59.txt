# Agent Modeling under Partial Observability for Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Deep Dive

In the realm of autonomous systems and artificial intelligence, the ability of an agent to understand and predict the behavior of other agents is crucial. Such capability enables more effective decision-making in complex scenarios, whether they are cooperative, competitive, or a mix of both. This blog post delves into a novel approach for agent modeling in such environments, leveraging the power of deep reinforcement learning (RL) under partial observability.

## Introduction

Autonomous decision-making agents need to interact seamlessly with other agents, often without complete information about those agents' intentions and behaviors. Traditional methods for agent modeling rely heavily on having access to the local observations and actions of other agents. However, in real-world scenarios, such an assumption is impractical due to limited visibility, unreliable communication, and lack of knowledge about other agents' perception systems. This post introduces a new approach that addresses these issues by using only local information available to the controlled agent during execution, improving the versatility and applicability of agent models.

## The Challenge of Partial Observability

In many environments, agents only have a partial view of the entire system. They must make decisions based on incomplete information, which makes predicting the actions of other agents particularly challenging. The question arises: Can we achieve effective agent modeling using only the local information of the controlled agent?

Deep learning techniques, particularly those involving encoder-decoder architectures, can extract informative features from data. This approach can be leveraged to model agent behaviors in partially observable settings without the need for extensive knowledge about other agents' local observations and actions during execution.

## Local Information Agent Modeling (LIAM)

LIAM is a methodology designed to learn the relationship between the trajectory of the controlled agent and the trajectory of the modelled agent. This method utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture to extract a compact yet informative representation of the modelled agents based solely on the local information of the controlled agent.

### How LIAM Works

1. **Encoder**: The encoder receives the local observations and actions of the controlled agent and generates latent representations that encapsulate the relevant features of the modelled agent's trajectory.
2. **Decoder**: During training, the decoder reconstructs the observations and actions of the modelled agent from these latent representations. After training, only the encoder is retained, which allows the controlled agent to generate representations using just its local observations.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The latent variables generated by the encoder augment the controlled agent's decision policy, which is trained concurrently using deep RL algorithms.

### Evaluation Scenarios

LIAM has been evaluated in three distinct multi-agent environments:
- **Double Speaker-Listener (DSL)**: A cooperative environment where agents must navigate to color-coded landmarks.
- **Level-Based Foraging (LBF)**: A mixed environment where agents must cooperate to collect food items, with rewards proportional to the food's level.
- **Predator-Prey (PP)**: A competitive environment where predators chase a prey, and the prey must avoid capture.

In all these environments, LIAM achieved higher average returns compared to baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling agent behaviors using local information alone.

## Comparative Analysis with Baselines

### Full Information Agent Model (FIAM)

FIAM assumes access to the modelled agents' trajectories during execution, representing an upper performance bound. While FIAM performed better due to more information, LIAM's performance was close, showcasing its robustness.

### No Agent Model (NAM)

NAM does not use explicit agent modeling and serves as a lower performance bound. LIAM significantly outperformed NAM, highlighting the benefits of explicit agent modeling.

### VariBad and Other Baselines

VariBad, CBAM, and CARL were also evaluated. VariBad uses a variational approach for task adaptation, while CBAM and CARL focus on identifying policy identities and learning contrastive representations, respectively. LIAM consistently outperformed these baselines, proving that leveraging the modelled agent's trajectory during training leads to better performance.

## Model Evaluation

Visualizing the embedding space generated by LIAM's encoder revealed distinct clusters corresponding to different agent policies. This clustering indicates that LIAM's embeddings effectively encapsulate the relevant features of the modelled agents' trajectories. Furthermore, LIAM demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the modelled agents' actions and identifying the controlled agent's hidden attributes (e.g., color) based on its interactions.

## Ablation Studies

To understand the contribution of different components in LIAM, several ablated versions were evaluated. The results confirmed that both action and observation reconstructions are crucial for performance. Additionally, using both the controlled agent's actions and observations in the encoder led to better results than using either alone.

## Scalability and Practical Applications

LIAM's ability to handle a wide range of fixed policies (up to 100) was tested, demonstrating its scalability. This makes LIAM suitable for various real-world applications, such as robotics, where agents must adapt to diverse and dynamic environments.

## Conclusion

LIAM presents a significant advancement in agent modeling under partial observability, enabling more effective decision-making with limited information. It bridges the gap between theoretical models and practical applications, offering a robust solution for multi-agent systems. Future work will explore extending LIAM to multi-agent reinforcement learning settings and addressing challenges such as high-dimensional observations and non-reactive agents.
