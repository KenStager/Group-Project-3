# Building Better Human-Agent Teams: Balancing Helpfulness and Humanness in Voice

In today's tech-driven world, voice agents have become integral to our daily routines. From selecting songs while driving to managing shopping lists and seeking real-time information, these agents simplify our lives. They've also extended their utility to more complex environments, such as mental health care and enhancing collective intelligence. As we look towards future applications where these agents could support groups of humans, understanding the fundamental components of human-agent teamwork becomes crucial. This blog delves into a recent study examining how the helpfulness and humanness of a voice-only agent influence team dynamics and performance.

## Introduction

Voice agents are no longer a novelty; they are a necessity in many aspects of our lives. With their growing prevalence, it becomes essential to comprehend how these agents can be designed to work more effectively within human teams. Specifically, the study "Building Better Human-Agent Teams: Tradeoffs in Helpfulness and Humanness in Voice" investigates how the helpfulness of a voice agent and its vocal type (human-like or robotic) impact team performance and perceptions during collaborative problem-solving tasks. Understanding these dynamics can lead to better design and implementation of voice agents in various team settings, enhancing their effectiveness and acceptance.

## The Experiment: Manipulating Helpfulness and Humanness

The researchers conducted an experiment involving 20 teams, each consisting of three or four humans and one voice-only agent. The teams were tasked with solving a complex puzzle using online video conferencing software. The voice agent's role was manipulated in two dimensions: helpfulness (helpful or unhelpful) and vocal type (human-like or robotic). The goal was to observe how these factors influenced team performance and members' perceptions of the agent.

### Methodology

The experiment employed a 2x2 between-subjects design with random treatment assignment. Participants were aged 18 to 34 and were divided into teams that completed the puzzle task with the assistance of the voice agent. The agent provided clues that were either helpful or misleading, and its voice was either human-like or robotic. After the task, participants filled out a questionnaire to measure their perceptions of the agent's anthropomorphism (human-like qualities), animacy (perception of acting on its own), intelligence, and trustworthiness.

### Key Findings

1. **Helpfulness Over Humanness**: The study found that the helpfulness of the agent significantly influenced perceptions of its intelligence and trustworthiness, as well as team performance. Interestingly, the vocal type (human-like or robotic) did not significantly affect these perceptions or outcomes. This suggests that in team scenarios, the functionality of the agent is more critical than its form.

2. **Interactive Effects**: There was a notable interaction between the agent's helpfulness and its vocal type on perceptions of anthropomorphism and animacy. A helpful robotic-voiced agent was seen as more human-like than an unhelpful one, while a helpful human-voiced agent was perceived as less human-like compared to its unhelpful counterpart. This indicates that expectations and social scripts play a role in how team members interpret the agent's contributions based on its vocal type.

3. **Team Performance**: Teams with a helpful agent performed better than those with an unhelpful agent, but this effect was only significant at the three-quarter mark of the task. By the end of the task, teams had adjusted to the helpfulness of the agent and performed similarly regardless of the vocal type. This suggests that while initial perceptions can be influenced by the agent's form, performance outcomes are ultimately driven by the agent's functionality.

## Implications for Design

The findings highlight several important considerations for designing voice agents for use in team settings:

- **Prioritize Functionality**: Ensure that the agent provides accurate and helpful information. Functionality should be the primary focus, as it has a more significant impact on team performance and perceptions of the agent's intelligence and trustworthiness.
- **Manage Expectations**: Be aware of how the agent's vocal type can influence team members' expectations and interpretations of its contributions. Aligning the agent's capabilities with its form can help manage these expectations effectively.
- **Team Dynamics**: Understand that while initial interactions may be influenced by the agent's form, over time, team members will base their judgments on the agent's actual contributions. Ensuring consistent performance can help build long-term trust and effectiveness in human-agent teams.

## Engaging the Audience

As we continue to integrate voice agents into our collaborative environments, it's essential to consider both their functionality and form. What are your experiences with voice agents in team settings? Have you found them to be more effective when they sound more human, or does their helpfulness take precedence?

## Conclusion

Voice agents hold great potential for enhancing team performance across various domains. This study underscores the importance of prioritizing an agent's functionality over its form, revealing that helpfulness plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions and outcomes in human-agent teams. As we move forward, designers and practitioners should focus on optimizing the capabilities of voice agents while being mindful of how their form influences team dynamics and expectations. By doing so, we can create more effective and harmonious human-agent collaborations.
