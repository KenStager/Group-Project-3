## A Multi-Agent Approach to Optimal Sizing of a Combined Heating and Power Microgrid

### Introduction

In an era where sustainable energy systems are increasingly critical due to the depletion of fossil fuels, global warming, and climate change, innovations in renewable energy solutions are paramount. The 5th Iranian Conference on Renewable Energy & Distributed Generation (ICREDG2017) at the University of Guilan presented a significant advancement in this field. Researchers Soheil Mohseni and Seyed Masoud Moghaddas Tafreshi from the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Guilan discussed a novel approach to optimal sizing of a combined heating and power residential microgrid using a multi-agent system (MAS). This blog post will delve into their study, exploring the multi-agent method and its implications for the future of residential energy systems.

### The Importance of Sustainable Energy Systems

Sustainable energy systems have garnered global attention as a response to pressing environmental issues. Renewable energy sources (RESs) like wind and solar power are widely accepted as sustainable alternatives. A microgrid, defined as a low-voltage distribution system comprising distributed energy resources, storage devices, and controllable loads, can operate independently or in conjunction with the main power grid. These systems are essential for maximizing the utilization of distributed energy resources (DERs), thus playing a crucial role in the adoption of renewable energy technologies.

### Optimal Sizing of Microgrids: The Research Approach

The researchers tackled the challenge of optimal sizing of hybrid micro-combined heat and power (CHP) systems. Traditional methods using linear programming and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) have proven effective. However, Mohseni and Tafreshi's study introduces a more sophisticated multi-agent-based method combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to determine the optimal component sizes for a residential microgrid.

The proposed microgrid configuration includes an array of components: photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines, fuel cells, electrolyzers, hydrogen storage tanks, boilers, heaters, and a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) refilling station. This setup ensures that the residential power and heat demands, along with the hydrogen refilling requirements for FCEVs, are consistently met.

### Understanding the Multi-Agent System (MAS)

A multi-agent system (MAS) comprises multiple interacting agents, each responsible for specific tasks within the microgrid. In this study, the MAS includes five agents: the generation agent (GA), load agent (LA), refilling station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA). These agents operate at different levels to ensure efficient energy management and optimal sizing of the microgrid components.

#### Hierarchical Structure of MAS

1. **Field Level**: The GA, LA, and SA operate at this level, managing the generation and consumption of electricity, heat, and hydrogen. The GA oversees the PV arrays, wind turbines, and fuel cells, while the LA aggregates all residential electricity and heat loads. The SA handles the hydrogen refilling station.

2. **Coordination Level**: The CA coordinates the interactions between the generation and consumption agents, ensuring that the energy management strategy is executed effectively.

3. **Design Level**: The DA is the highest level, responsible for calculating the optimal sizes of the microgrid components using PSO and minimizing the total system costs.

### Simulation and Results

The simulation of the proposed MAS-based architecture was conducted using MATLAB, with the microgrid's annual solar radiation and wind speed data as input variables. Two scenarios were considered to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method:

#### Scenario 1: Fixed Loads

In the first scenario, hydrogen refilling and electrical loads were considered fixed. The MAS aimed to meet these demands without deferring or interrupting any loads. The optimal sizes of the microgrid components in this scenario resulted in a total cost of $36,547,871.

#### Scenario 2: Managed Loads

In the second scenario, 15% of the electrical loads were deemed interruptible, and hydrogen refilling was treated as a deferrable load. This energy management strategy allowed for better utilization of resources and avoidance of peak-hour overloads. The optimal sizes of the components in this scenario led to a reduced total cost of $34,911,246.

### Key Insights from the Study

1. **Cost Reduction**: By leveraging deferrable and interruptible loads, the MAS successfully reduced the total cost of the microgrid. The optimal size of PV arrays, fuel cells, and boilers decreased, while the size of wind turbines, electrolyzers, and heaters increased. This balance resulted in significant cost savings.

2. **Resource Optimization**: The proposed MAS ensured better utilization of available resources. By managing the timing of hydrogen refilling and electrical loads, the system could avoid peak-hour overloads and distribute energy usage more efficiently.

3. **Environmental Benefits**: The optimized system not only reduced costs but also decreased pollution penalties associated with the boiler's emissions. This approach highlights the dual benefits of economic and environmental improvements.

### Conclusion

The study presented by Soheil Mohseni and Seyed Masoud Moghaddas Tafreshi at ICREDG2017 showcases a groundbreaking multi-agent approach for the optimal sizing of a combined heating and power microgrid. By integrating renewable energy sources and advanced energy management strategies, this method offers a promising solution for residential energy systems. The significant cost reductions and environmental benefits underscore the potential of MAS in shaping a sustainable energy future.
