## Understanding Partially Controlled Multi-Agent Systems: Insights and Techniques

In the evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), the control and coordination of multiple agents present a unique set of challenges and opportunities. The concept of Partially Controlled Multi-Agent Systems (PCMAS) introduces a distinction between controllable agents, which are directly under the designer's control, and uncontrollable agents, which operate independently. This article delves into the nuances of PCMAS, exploring how to influence uncontrollable agents through strategic design and highlighting two case studies focused on social law enforcement and embedded teaching.

### Introduction

The idea of controlling various entities within a system is not new; it lies at the heart of multiple engineering disciplines, notably Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Discrete Event Systems (DES). Both fields have independently developed methodologies for managing multi-agent environments, incorporating unique assumptions and techniques. However, PCMAS represents a convergence point, borrowing insights from both AI's focus on self-motivated agents and DES's distinction between controllable and uncontrollable events.

### Body

#### Distinguishing Controllable and Uncontrollable Agents

In typical DES models, events are categorized as controllable or uncontrollable based on the designer's ability to influence them directly. Translating this to multi-agent systems, we introduce controllable agents, which the system designer can manage, and uncontrollable agents, which act independently. This distinction leads to the concept of partially controlled multi-agent systems and the challenge of ensuring appropriate behavior across the board. The ultimate goal is to design controllable agents in such a way that they can indirectly influence uncontrollable agents to achieve the desired system behavior.

#### Social Law Enforcement in Multi-Agent Systems

One of the primary applications of PCMAS is the enforcement of social laws. When multiple agents designed by different creators operate within a shared environment, enforcing certain conventions or social laws can significantly enhance the system's efficiency. For instance, imposing traffic laws on robots in a warehouse can streamline their movements and prevent congestion.

However, rational agents, who aim to maximize their utility, might be tempted to bypass these conventions if it benefits them. To address this, the concept of punishment is introduced. Controllable agents are designed to penalize non-compliant behavior by implementing "punishing strategies" that make deviations from the social norms unattractive. This dynamic is akin to a game-theoretic approach where the equilibrium must be maintained through strategic deterrence.

#### Embedded Teaching: Influencing Learning Agents

Another compelling application of PCMAS is in the domain of embedded teaching, where a knowledgeable agent (the teacher) influences a learning agent (the student). The teacher's objective is to guide the student towards a desired behavior despite not having direct control over the student's actions.

Consider a two-agent system where the teacher and student repeatedly engage in joint activities. The teacher, knowing the dynamics of the environment, uses her actions to steer the student's learning process. This scenario can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the teacher's actions aim to maximize the long-term benefits (or rewards) for the student. The teacher employs techniques such as reinforcement learning, where good behavior is rewarded and undesirable actions are punished, to influence the student's learning trajectory.

#### Optimal Strategies and Experimental Insights

Experiments with different types of reinforcement learners, including Blind Q-learners (BQLs) and Q-learners (QLs), reveal various strategies' effectiveness. For instance, Tit-For-Tat (TFT) is a simple yet effective strategy where the teacher mimics the student's previous action, rewarding cooperation with cooperation and punishing defection with defection. This method aligns with the principles of punishment and reward, demonstrating significant success in influencing the student's behavior.

### Conclusion

In summary, the study of partially controlled multi-agent systems highlights the intricate balance between influence and autonomy within AI environments. By leveraging concepts from game theory and reinforcement learning, we can design controllable agents that effectively guide their uncontrollable counterparts. This approach not only ensures system-wide efficiency but also opens up new avenues for research and application in AI and beyond.

As we continue to explore these dynamics, it is crucial to refine our strategies and methods, embracing the complexity of these systems to unlock their full potential. Whether through enforcing social laws or embedded teaching, the principles of PCMAS provide a robust framework for navigating the challenges of multi-agent coordination.
