### Agent Programming with Declarative Goals: Bridging Theory and Practice

**Introduction**

The realm of intelligent agent programming has witnessed significant advancements, but a persistent challenge has been bridging the gap between theoretical agent logics and practical agent programming frameworks. This challenge stems from a fundamental disconnect: most agent programming frameworks have traditionally focused on procedural plans or goals-to-do, rather than the end goals or goals-to-be that declarative goals represent. In this blog post, we explore a novel programming language called GOAL, which aims to incorporate declarative goals into agent programming. We'll delve into the theory behind GOAL, its operational semantics, and provide insights into its application through a practical example.

**Understanding Agent Programming**

Intelligent agents, which can operate autonomously, have become a central topic in artificial intelligence and mainstream computer science. These agents, whether software or hardware, must exhibit both reactive (responding to the environment) and proactive (taking initiative) behaviors. This dual nature is often modeled through an agent's mental state, comprising beliefs and goals.

Early efforts in agent research aimed to formalize these concepts using logical systems, resulting in various modal logics defining beliefs, goals, and intentions. However, linking these logical frameworks with practical programming languages has remained elusive. Existing languages like Agent-0, AgentSpeak, and 3APL define agents in terms of beliefs and procedural goals but lack a declarative perspective. This absence hinders the use of modal logics for verifying agent programs.

**Introducing GOAL: A Declarative Approach**

GOAL (Goal-Oriented Agent Language) is designed to bridge this gap by incorporating declarative goals into agent programming. Inspired by the UNITY language for concurrent programming, GOAL defines agents based on their mental states (beliefs and goals) and capabilities (actions). Unlike procedural goals, which are action sequences, declarative goals in GOAL define desired end states, allowing a more intuitive representation of intelligent agents.

**GOAL's Operational Semantics**

The operational semantics of GOAL are built around a commitment strategy that dictates how agents manage their goals. Specifically, an agent commits to a goal until it believes the goal has been achieved. This strategy is implemented through a mental state transformer function that updates both beliefs and goals.

### The Programming Language GOAL

**Mental States and Actions**

A GOAL agent's mental state includes its beliefs and goals, both expressed in a logical language. The agent's capabilities consist of basic actions that update its beliefs and goals. For instance, an agent might have actions to add or remove beliefs (e.g., `ins(ϕ)`, `del(ϕ)`) and to adopt or drop goals (`adopt(ϕ)`, `drop(ϕ)`).

**Defining Agents**

A GOAL agent is defined by its initial mental state and a set of conditional actions. These actions include a mental state condition and a basic action, specifying what the agent should do when certain conditions are met. The execution of these actions updates the agent's mental state accordingly.

### Applying GOAL: A Personal Assistant Example

To illustrate GOAL in action, consider a shopping agent programmed to buy books online. The agent's capabilities might include actions like navigating to a website, searching for a book, adding a book to the cart, and checking out. The agent's initial beliefs and goals are specified, and its behavior is governed by conditional actions reflecting the shopping process.

**Example Program:**

```
Capabilities:
goto website(site)
search(book)
put in shopping cart(book)
pay cart

Initial Beliefs:
current webpage(hpage(user))
∀s, s’((s ≠ s’ ∧ current webpage(s)) -> ¬current webpage(s’))

Initial Goals:
bought(The Intentional Stance)
bought(Intentions, Plans, and Practical Reason)
```

**Program Logic:**

```
B(current website(hpage(user)) ∨ current website(ContentCart))
∧ G(bought(book)) -> do(goto website(Am.com))

B(current website(Am.com)) ∧ ¬B(in cart(book)) ∧
G(bought(book)) -> do(search(book))

B(current website(book)) ∧ G(bought(book))
-> do(put in shopping cart(book))

B(in cart(book)) ∧ G(bought(book))
-> do(pay cart)
```

### Formal Verification with GOAL

**Proof Theory**

GOAL's proof theory allows verifying agent properties using temporal logic. Properties like invariants (conditions that always hold) and liveness (eventual goal achievement) can be proven by inspecting the program text and deriving Hoare triples (precondition-action-postcondition specifications). This formal verification ensures that the agent behaves as intended and achieves its goals.

### Extending GOAL

**Future Directions**

While GOAL provides a robust framework for agent programming, future extensions could include more complex action structures, high-level communication primitives, and support for nested belief and goal operators. Combining GOAL with languages like 3APL could offer a comprehensive framework that integrates declarative goals and planning features.

### Conclusion

GOAL represents a significant step forward in agent programming, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical agent logics and practical programming frameworks. By incorporating declarative goals, GOAL allows for more intuitive and flexible agent design. As we continue to explore and refine this language, GOAL has the potential to become a cornerstone in the development of intelligent agents.
