# Exploring Languages for Mobile Agents: A Journey into Network Computing

### Introduction

In an era where network computing is becoming increasingly complex, mobile agents emerge as a promising technology to simplify operations and enhance efficiency. Essentially, a mobile agent is a program capable of migrating from one computer to another within a network to execute specific tasks. This blog post delves into the characteristics that make certain programming languages suitable for writing mobile agents, examining notable examples such as Telescript, Java, Agent Tcl, and Obliq. We'll explore their features, strengths, limitations, and the practical applications they enable. By the end, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of mobile agent programming languages.

### Background

Mobile agents are not a new concept but are evolving from research prototypes to practical tools in mainstream computing. The primary advantage of mobile agents lies in their ability to move closer to information resources, leveraging server services through dispatched programs. Unlike traditional client-server models, mobile agents simplify the implementation of new functionalities by adding an abstraction layer between server services and their utilization.

Mobile agents can be applied in various scenarios, including search and gathering applications, monitoring programs, electronic commerce, and distributed computing. Let's consider a practical example: a user needs to be notified when the stock price of BHP rises above a certain threshold. A mobile agent can be dispatched to a stock exchange server to monitor sales in real-time. Once the condition is met, the agent returns to inform the user, significantly reducing network communication compared to traditional methods.

### Languages Used to Write Mobile Agents

Any programming language that supports an execution environment on the host can, theoretically, be used to implement mobile agents. However, some languages are specifically designed for this purpose, while others are general-purpose languages extended with special libraries. Here, we explore a few prominent examples:

#### Telescript

Developed by General Magic, Telescript is designed explicitly for mobile agent systems. It is an object-oriented language with built-in support for agent migration, communication, and interaction with local resources. Telescript's vision was to make computer networks a programmable platform, akin to what Postscript is for printing. Despite its proprietary nature, Telescript has greatly influenced mobile agent technology.

#### Java

Java, although not specifically designed for mobile agents, has proven highly capable in this area due to its object-oriented nature, multi-threading, and platform independence. Java programs are compiled into bytecode that can run on any machine with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Several mobile agent systems are built on Java, utilizing its Remote Method Invocation (RMI) capabilities. Notable systems include IBM's Aglets and General Magic's Odyssey.

#### Agent Tcl

Agent Tcl, developed by Dartmouth College, extends the Tool Command Language (Tcl) to support mobile agents. It introduces commands for agent migration and message passing, enabling Tcl scripts to move seamlessly across different machines. Agent Tcl relies on the Safe Tcl interpreter for secure execution of mobile agents.

#### Obliq

An experimental language by Digital Equipment Corporation, Obliq is object-based and supports distributed computation. Obliq treats the network as a single computer with distributed sites, providing unique semantics for network computing. Its runtime type checking and lexical scoping contribute to both flexibility and security in a distributed environment.

### Characteristics of Languages for Mobile Agents

To be effective, languages for mobile agents must support several critical characteristics:

#### 1. Agent Migration
The language should allow agents to suspend execution, migrate to another computer, and resume execution seamlessly. Telescript and Agent Tcl have built-in support for this, while Java relies on workarounds like serialization.

#### 2. Agent Communication
Agents need to communicate with each other effectively. Telescript uses a meeting model, Agent Tcl employs message passing and remote procedure calls, and Java's Aglets utilize proxy objects for communication.

#### 3. Interaction with Local Resources
Access to server resources is fundamental for mobile agents. Telescript and Aglets use a model where local resources are represented as agents. Obliq requests services from sites and imports/export procedures for interaction.

#### 4. Security
Security is paramount, and languages must protect hosts from malicious agents and vice versa. Java uses a sandbox model, Agent Tcl employs safe interpreters, and Telescript assigns permits to control agent actions.

#### 5. Efficiency
While execution speed may not always be critical, it matters for resource allocation on servers. Java offers high performance for an interpreted language, while Tcl is slower but may suffice for many applications.

#### 6. Cross-Platform
Interpreted languages like Telescript, Java, and Agent Tcl are favored for their cross-platform capabilities. Java holds an edge with widespread JVM support, making it more accessible across different systems.

#### 7. Ease of Programming
The language must be user-friendly for developers. Object-oriented languages like Telescript and Java naturally model mobile agents, while scripting languages like Tcl offer rapid development cycles.

### Conclusion

Mobile agents are poised to revolutionize network computing by simplifying complex operations and enhancing flexibility. Among the languages examined, Telescript stands out for its specialized design, while Java's open specification and platform independence make it a strong contender. Agent Tcl offers a high-level scripting language for rapid development, and Obliq provides unique distributed semantics.

As mobile agents transition into mainstream computing, the choice of language will depend on specific requirements such as migration support, communication needs, security, and cross-platform compatibility. While Telescript may be superior in some aspects, Java's accessibility and widespread adoption position it as a likely standard for future mobile agent applications.
