# Adapting LLM Agents with Universal Feedback in Communication

## Introduction

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides, resembling human-like agents capable of complex interactions. The challenge, however, remains on how to effectively train these agents using both linguistic feedback (instructions) and non-linguistic reward signals. This is where the concept of Learning through Communication (LTC) comes into play. Developed by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Microsoft, LTC aims to bridge the gap by introducing a universal framework that leverages diverse feedback to train LLM agents more effectively. This blog post will delve into the intricacies of the LTC framework, its unique communication patterns, and its empirical success across various datasets.

## The LTC Framework

### The Universal Buffer and Iterative Pipeline

At the heart of LTC lies a universal buffer designed to store all forms of feedback. This buffer is integral to an iterative pipeline that allows LLM agents to explore their environments, gather diverse feedback, and update their policies accordingly. The LTC process is divided into two main phases:

1. **Exploration Phase**: Here, the agent interacts with its environment and other agents, collecting linguistic data (like dialogue) and non-linguistic reward signals. This data is stored in the universal buffer.
   
2. **Updating Phase**: During this phase, the agent's model is fine-tuned based on the data collected in the universal buffer. The LTC method employs both language modeling loss and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) loss to balance linguistic consistency and reward signal alignment.

### Versatile Communication Patterns

LTC introduces three primary communication patterns to handle different types of tasks:

1. **Single-agent Monologue**: This pattern allows a single agent to interact with its environment, collecting both linguistic data and reward signals. It is particularly useful for tasks requiring agents to think and act step-by-step.
   
2. **Multi-agent Dialogue**: In this pattern, multiple agents interact with each other and external tools. This setup is ideal for tasks involving collaboration or competition among agents, such as multi-hop reasoning or social deduction games.
   
3. **Teacher-student Dialogue**: This pattern involves a teacher agent providing direct feedback to a student agent. It is designed for complex analytical tasks like numerical reasoning, where detailed feedback and corrections are crucial.

## Empirical Evaluation

The effectiveness of the LTC framework was evaluated on four diverse datasets:

1. **ALFWorld**: A single-agent environment involving decision-making tasks.
2. **HotpotQA**: A multi-agent collaboration environment focused on knowledge-intensive reasoning.
3. **Chameleon**: A multi-agent competition environment for social deduction games.
4. **GSM8k**: A teacher-student environment for numerical reasoning tasks.

### Performance Highlights

- **ALFWorld**: LTC achieved a success rate of 91%, significantly outperforming the best instruction-tuning baseline by 12%.
  
- **HotpotQA**: LTC outperformed the instruction-tuning baseline by 5% on the Exact Match (EM) score and even surpassed some methods using much larger pre-trained models.
  
- **Chameleon**: LTC agents improved their winning rate by 3.1% against GPT-4 players, showcasing its effectiveness in competitive environments.
  
- **GSM8k**: LTC surpassed the instruction fine-tuning baseline by 3.6% in accuracy, effectively leveraging the teacher-student dialogue pattern.

## Discussion and Future Directions

One intriguing observation from the experiments was the use of "shortcuts" by GPT-4 agents to solve tasks quickly, relying on internal knowledge acquired during pretraining. This behavior was contrasted with LTC-trained LLaMA-7B agents, which demonstrated a more thorough search process. This highlights the additional benefits of the LTC framework in providing comprehensive learning experiences for LLM agents.

Future work in this domain aims to explore a broader range of communication patterns and incorporate human interactions into the iterative learning process. Open-sourcing the LTC framework will also facilitate further research and advancements in adaptive LLM agents.

## Conclusion

The Learning through Communication (LTC) framework represents a significant leap in training LLM agents using a combination of linguistic feedback and non-linguistic reward signals. By introducing versatile communication patterns and a universal buffer, LTC enables agents to adapt to various tasks and environments more effectively. The empirical success across different datasets underscores the potential of LTC in enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of LLM agents. As we look forward to more research in this field, the LTC framework paves the way for more intelligent and autonomous artificial agents.
