## The Design and Realization of Multi-agent Obstacle Avoidance Based on Reinforcement Learning

### Introduction

In today’s increasingly complex environments, intelligent agents and multi-agent systems have become indispensable. From factory robots to drone swarms in warfare, these systems must navigate dynamic and unpredictable settings, making sophisticated navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities critical. Traditional algorithms often fall short when tasked with such complexity, leading researchers to explore reinforcement learning solutions. This blog post delves into the challenges of multi-agent navigation and obstacle avoidance, exploring advanced reinforcement learning algorithms like MADDPG, their limitations, and new improvements like MADDPG-LSTMactor and MADDPG-L.

#### Multi-agent Systems: The Essentials

Intelligent agents are integral to many modern applications, including traffic regulation, computer games, and robotics. The multi-agent system architecture is particularly advantageous in complex tasks requiring communication and cooperation among agents. In fields like autonomous driving and warehouse robotics, the ability to navigate and avoid obstacles is essential.

#### Evolution of Navigation Algorithms

Traditional navigation algorithms can be grouped into three categories:
1. **Static Path Planning**: This involves modeling the activity scene and establishing a global map stored in the robot's hardware. However, it’s only effective when the map data is static and known.
2. **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**: Introduced in 1986 by Smith, SLAM optimizes map creation and positioning. Nevertheless, it struggles with dynamic environments due to sensor data uncertainty.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: With advancements in deep learning, reinforcement learning has been applied to multi-agent navigation, offering a solution to dynamic and complex environments.

#### Challenges in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning

Early multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms faced significant hurdles. For instance, Independent Q-learning (IQL) and Independent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (IDDPG) suffered from instability due to the inability of agents to access others' actions and observations. This led to problems in determining whether environmental changes were due to other agents' actions or random factors.

#### Introduction of MADDPG

Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) was a breakthrough, introducing Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE). This allowed agents to access global and other agents’ observations during training, leading to higher performance and stability. However, MADDPG’s reliance on centralized training made it less scalable as the number of agents increased, leading to exponentially growing joint action spaces.

#### Enhancements: MADDPG-LSTMactor and MADDPG-L

To address MADDPG’s limitations:
1. **MADDPG-LSTMactor**: This algorithm integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to handle temporal data, using agents' observations over continuous time steps as input. This enhancement allows the LSTM layer to process hidden temporal messages, improving performance in scenarios with fewer agents.
2. **MADDPG-L**: For environments with a large number of agents, MADDPG-L simplifies the critic network input, focusing only on each agent’s own actions and the environment state. This approach mitigates the action space explosion problem, demonstrating improved performance in large-scale agent scenarios.

#### Experimental Results

Multiple experiments in various environments showcased the performance of these algorithms:
1. **Obstacle Predator-Prey**: Algorithms like MADDPG-LSTMactor demonstrated superior performance over MADDPG, particularly in small agent scenarios. However, MADDPG-L showed better scalability and efficiency with larger agent numbers.
2. **Spread**: Tests across environments with varying agent numbers showed MADDPG-LSTMactor excelled with fewer agents, while MADDPG-L outperformed others as agent numbers increased.
3. **Tunnel and Simple Tunnel**: Similar trends were observed, with MADDPG-LSTMactor offering better performance and learning speed in smaller scenarios and MADDPG-L excelling as agent complexity increased.
