# Leveraging Agent Topology for Cooperative Multi-Agent Policy Gradient

In recent years, the field of reinforcement learning (RL) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has seen significant advancements, leading to exciting applications in areas such as unmanned vehicles, traffic signal control, and on-demand delivery. However, despite these advancements, existing Multi-Agent Policy Gradient (MAPG) methods face challenges, particularly the centralized-decentralized mismatch (CDM) issue. To address this, researchers have proposed an innovative framework called Topology-based multi-Agent Policy gradiEnt (TAPE). This blog post delves into the intricacies of TAPE, how it addresses the CDM issue, and its implications for cooperative multi-agent systems.

## Introduction

The field of MARL has evolved rapidly, enabling multiple agents to learn policies that can be deployed in complex environments. However, achieving effective cooperation among agents remains a challenge due to the CDM issue. This problem arises when sub-optimal actions by some agents negatively impact the policy learning of others, leading to poor overall performance. In response, researchers have introduced TAPE, which leverages agent topology to strike a balance between cooperation and mitigating the CDM issue. This post explores TAPE's theoretical foundations, empirical results, and its potential to revolutionize cooperative multi-agent systems.

## Understanding the CDM Issue in MAPG

Traditional MAPG methods rely on centralized critics or value-mixing networks to provide learning signals. While these approaches promote cooperation and credit assignment, they also suffer from the CDM issue. This occurs because sub-optimal or exploratory actions by some agents can lead to a low global Q value, causing other agents to perceive their optimal actions as sub-optimal. The Decomposed Off-Policy (DOP) approach attempts to address this by using individual critics, but this significantly limits cooperation among agents.

### Example: The One-Step Matrix Game

Consider a one-step matrix game involving two agents, A and B. Each agent has two actions: a0 (optimal) and a1 (non-optimal). The rewards are as follows: R(a0, a0) = 2, R(a0, a1) = -4, R(a1, a0) = -1, and R(a1, a1) = 0. If agent A takes the optimal action a0 and B takes the non-optimal action a1, agent A's counterfactual advantage becomes negative, leading it to mistakenly reduce the probability of taking a0 in the future. This illustrates how sub-optimal actions by one agent can adversely affect the learning of others.

## The TAPE Framework

TAPE introduces an agent topology framework designed to mitigate the CDM issue while enhancing cooperation. The agent topology determines the relationships between agents' policy updates, allowing agents to form coalitions. Within these coalitions, agents consider and maximize each other's utilities, facilitating cooperation and reducing the impact of out-of-coalition agents' sub-optimal actions.

### Stochastic and Deterministic TAPE

TAPE supports both stochastic and deterministic MAPG methods. Stochastic TAPE aggregates individual utilities and critics using coalition utility as the learning objective. This approach ensures that policy updates maximize the local utilities of in-coalition agents, promoting cooperation.

In deterministic TAPE, a mixing network combines local Q values to form a Coalition Q. By masking out the utilities of out-of-coalition agents, deterministic TAPE prevents sub-optimal actions from affecting in-coalition agents, thus improving overall performance.

## Empirical Results

The efficacy of TAPE has been demonstrated through experiments on various benchmarks, including matrix games, Level-Based Foraging (LBF), and the Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC).

### Matrix Games

In matrix games, where strong cooperation is required, stochastic TAPE outperformed other methods by a significant margin, demonstrating its ability to learn optimal joint policies even in challenging scenarios.

### Level-Based Foraging

In LBF scenarios, stochastic TAPE achieved superior performance in simpler tasks due to its enhanced cooperation capabilities. In more complex tasks, deterministic TAPE excelled by effectively mitigating the impact of sub-optimal actions.

### Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge

In SMAC, TAPE consistently outperformed baseline methods in terms of both performance and convergence speed. This highlights the framework's effectiveness in facilitating cooperation and addressing the CDM issue.

## Theoretical Insights and Practical Implications

TAPE's theoretical foundation includes a policy improvement theorem for stochastic TAPE, which ensures that policy updates lead to monotonically increasing performance. Additionally, TAPE's agent topology allows for diverse exploration of cooperation patterns, enhancing the agents' ability to find effective strategies.

### Selecting the Right Agent Topology

Experiments with different random graph models (e.g., Barabási–Albert, Watts–Strogatz, and Erdős–Rényi) revealed that the Erdős–Rényi model generates the most diverse topologies, facilitating robust cooperation and strong performance. This diversity is crucial for exploring various cooperation patterns and achieving optimal results.

## Conclusion

TAPE represents a significant advancement in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. By leveraging agent topology, TAPE effectively addresses the CDM issue while promoting cooperation among agents. The framework's theoretical robustness and empirical success demonstrate its potential to enhance the performance of multi-agent systems in various real-world applications.
