## Introduction

In the dynamic field of artificial intelligence, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a pivotal area of research, driven by the complexity of environments where multiple agents interact. Unlike single-agent reinforcement learning, MARL faces unique challenges such as the need for agents to collaborate or compete, making the learning process far more intricate. In this blog post, we delve into a novel approach to MARLâ€”introducing cooperative and competitive biases to enhance training efficiency. Based on the groundbreaking research by Heechang Ryu, Hayong Shin, and Jinkyoo Park from KAIST, we explore the Friend-or-Foe Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (F2DDPG) algorithm. This method leverages biased action information to improve agent interactions in mixed cooperative-competitive settings, demonstrating superior performance over existing algorithms.

## The Complexity of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to solve sequential decision-making problems by allowing an agent to learn from interactions within an environment. The goal is to estimate an action-value function, or Q-function, which predicts the future rewards of actions taken in specific states, enabling the agent to optimize its behavior for maximum long-term benefit. However, the introduction of multiple agents significantly complicates this process. In MARL, each agent must not only learn from its own experience but also adapt to the behaviors of other agents, which can be either cooperative or competitive.

### Sparse and Delayed Rewards

One of the key challenges in MARL is the presence of sparse or delayed rewards. In many scenarios, agents receive feedback infrequently, making it difficult to associate specific actions with outcomes. Techniques like Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) have been developed to address this by transforming sparse-reward environments into dense-reward ones, where every experience contributes to learning. However, even with such techniques, the multi-agent context remains challenging due to the need for complex coordination and strategy formation.

## Enhancing MARL with Cooperative and Competitive Biases

To tackle these challenges, the F2DDPG algorithm introduces the concept of biased action information based on the friend-or-foe paradigm. This algorithm categorizes agents into two groups: friends (cooperative) and foes (competitive). Each agent updates its value function not only based on its actions but also considering the biased actions of other agents in these groups. This approach simulates a more interactive environment, where agents are encouraged to engage in meaningful cooperation or competition, thereby enhancing overall training efficiency.

### The Mechanisms of F2DDPG

1. **Biased Joint Actions**: For cooperative agents, the biased joint action is the sum of their actual joint action and an imaginary cooperative joint action, derived under the assumption that all cooperative agents aim to maximize the target agent's value function. Similarly, competitive agents' biased joint action is computed to minimize the target agent's value function.

2. **Value Function Update**: Each agent updates its value function using these biased joint actions, leading to a biased value function and policy. This process ensures that agents' policies are influenced to either cooperate or compete more effectively, fostering dynamic interactions that are crucial for mixed environments.

3. **Empirical Validation**: The researchers empirically demonstrated that F2DDPG outperforms existing algorithms in various mixed cooperative-competitive environments. The biases introduced during training gradually diminish, as the agents' policies become more aligned with their actual behaviors, leading to unbiased and effective policy learning.

## Comparing Approaches in MARL

### Friend-or-Foe Q-Learning

The Friend-or-Foe Q-Learning (FFQ) approach serves as a foundation for F2DDPG. In general-sum games, FFQ categorizes other agents as either friends or foes and assumes that friends work to maximize a target agent's value while foes aim to minimize it. This simplification transforms the problem into a manageable two-player zero-sum game, providing strong convergence guarantees and facilitating the implementation of MARL algorithms.

### Biases in Reinforcement Learning

Biases in state, reward, and action information have been leveraged to enhance learning in RL and MARL. For instance:

- **State Biases**: Injecting biased beliefs about the state at the initialization stage can improve learning efficiency, especially in goal-oriented tasks where prior knowledge about the goal's location helps shape the value function.
- **Reward Biases**: Intrinsic rewards designed to promote specific behaviors, such as state transition influence or exploration of new state spaces, can significantly aid multi-agent exploration.
- **Action Biases**: Algorithms like M3DDPG introduce adversarial noise to other agents' actions, training robust policies by assuming worst-case scenarios. However, F2DDPG offers a more nuanced approach by considering the actual roles of agents.

## Practical Application: Experimental Environments

The researchers evaluated F2DDPG across several experimental environments, including cooperative and mixed cooperative-competitive settings:

1. **Cooperative Navigation**: In this task, agents must cover all landmarks without collisions, requiring strategic cooperation. F2DDPG outperformed baseline algorithms due to its effective use of cooperative biases, promoting coherent exploratory actions.
2. **Cooperative Communication**: Here, a speaker-agent communicates information to guide a listener-agent to the correct landmark. F2DDPG excelled by enhancing the coordination between agents through biased actions.
3. **Predator-Prey**: In this mixed environment, predators must cooperate to capture faster prey. F2DDPG achieved higher rewards than baseline algorithms, demonstrating its ability to foster strategic cooperation among predators.
4. **Covert Communication**: This scenario involved a speaker, listener, and adversary. The speaker and listener had to communicate covertly, avoiding detection by the adversary. F2DDPG showed superior performance by maintaining high rewards even as the adversary became more intelligent.

## Conclusion

The F2DDPG algorithm represents a significant advancement in multi-agent reinforcement learning by effectively integrating cooperative and competitive biases. This approach not only enhances the learning process but also ensures that agents develop strategies aligned with their roles in the environment. By fostering dynamic and meaningful interactions among agents, F2DDPG sets a new standard for MARL, promising improved performance in diverse and complex scenarios.
