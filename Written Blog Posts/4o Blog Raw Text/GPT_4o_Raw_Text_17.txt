## Summarizing Policy Disagreements for Agent Comparison: A Novel Approach

### Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a vital part of our daily lives, influencing a range of domains from healthcare to transportation. As our interactions with AI-driven autonomous agents grow, understanding these agents' behaviors becomes crucial for effective collaboration. This understanding helps prevent reduced productivity, misuse, or even frustration. Traditionally, strategy summarization methods have been used to provide users insights into an agent's behavior. However, these methods often fall short when it comes to comparing different agents. This blog post delves into a groundbreaking approach proposed by Yotam Amitai and Ofra Amir from the Technion I.I.T., which aims to address these limitations by generating summaries that highlight disagreements between agents. 

### The Need for Effective Agent Comparisons

As reinforcement learning (RL) methods evolve, RL-based agents are being deployed in increasingly complex tasks across various domains. For instance, in healthcare, clinicians need to understand AI recommendations to make informed decisions about patient treatment options. Similarly, consumers choosing between smart home assistants or self-driving cars may have different priorities and preferences. Traditional strategy summarization methods, which provide a summary of an agent's behavior based on a selected set of states, are often optimized independently for each agent. This independence can obscure significant differences in agents' strategies, especially when agents behave similarly in "important" states.

### Existing Methods and Their Limitations

Current strategy summarization methods like HIGHLIGHTS generate summaries based on the importance of states determined by their Q-values—essentially the agent's estimated reward for taking certain actions in those states. While HIGHLIGHTS and similar algorithms effectively help users develop mental models of individual agent behaviors, they aren't designed to compare multiple agents effectively. When high-quality agents are compared, they often highlight the same states, leading to similar summaries. This similarity can make it challenging to discern meaningful differences between agents' policies.

### Introducing the DISAGREEMENTS Algorithm

To address these challenges, Amitai and Amir have developed the DISAGREEMENTS algorithm, specifically optimized for comparing agent policies by identifying and highlighting states where agents disagree on the best course of action. This approach simulates agents in parallel and notes where their strategies diverge. These disagreement states are then used to generate visual summaries that emphasize the most prominent conflicts between agents, thereby providing a clear contrast of their behaviors.

### Evaluating DISAGREEMENTS

The researchers conducted user studies to assess whether disagreement-based summaries improved users' ability to identify superior agents and effectively conveyed differences between agents. The studies compared DISAGREEMENTS against HIGHLIGHTS, showing that DISAGREEMENTS significantly improved user performance in identifying superior agents and understanding behavioral differences.

### Experimentation and Results

#### Experiment 1: Identifying Superior Agents

Participants were tasked with identifying the better-performing agent using summaries generated by either DISAGREEMENTS or HIGHLIGHTS. The results were compelling: participants using DISAGREEMENTS summaries were significantly more successful in identifying the superior agent. This success was attributed to the contrastive nature of DISAGREEMENTS summaries, which made it easier for users to discern differences in agents' strategies.

#### Experiment 2: Conveying Agent Differences

The second experiment evaluated how well each summarization method conveyed general behavior differences between agents. Participants again showed a preference for DISAGREEMENTS summaries, which provided clearer and more contrastive distinctions between agents' behaviors.

### Practical Implications

The ability to effectively compare autonomous agents has far-reaching implications. For consumers, it means making more informed choices between various AI-driven products, whether they are selecting a self-driving car that prioritizes safety or one that values speed. For developers and researchers, it means a deeper understanding of how different reward functions and algorithm parameters impact agent behavior, which is crucial for refining and improving AI models.

### Conclusion

As AI continues to integrate into more aspects of our lives, tools like the DISAGREEMENTS algorithm will be essential in helping users and developers alike make sense of complex agent behaviors. By highlighting where agents disagree, this novel approach provides a clearer, more practical means of comparing AI strategies, ultimately leading to better decision-making and more effective human-agent collaboration.
