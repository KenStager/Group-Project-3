### Development of a Multi-Agent System for Optimal Sizing of a Commercial Complex Microgrid

The 5th Iranian Conference on Renewable Energy & Distributed Generation (ICREDG2017) held at the University of Guilan brought together experts in the field to discuss innovative solutions to energy management problems. Among the leading discussions was the development of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for optimal sizing of commercial complex microgrids, presented by Soheil Mohseni and Seyed Masoud Moghaddas Tafreshi from the University of Guilan.

Microgrids are gaining popularity for their ability to integrate renewable energy sources (RES), such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, and manage the charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). This blog post delves into the intelligent MAS proposed by Mohseni and Tafreshi, which aims to efficiently size the components of a microgrid to meet the electricity and charging demands of a commercial complex while considering reliability and cost-effectiveness.

#### Introduction

As the global energy landscape shifts towards more sustainable sources, the optimization of energy systems becomes crucial. Residential and commercial buildings alone consume about 32% of global energy and contribute significantly to CO2 emissions. Integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar power and electric vehicles can mitigate these impacts by reducing reliance on conventional energy sources. This is where microgrids come in, offering a flexible and sustainable solution.

In our contemporary world, implementing intelligent systems to manage energy usage and generation in microgrids is essential for maximizing efficiency. This blog post will explore the MAS approach proposed by Mohseni and Tafreshi for optimal component sizing in a commercial complex microgrid. Readers will understand the components and architecture of the proposed system and its simulation results, which highlight its efficiency and cost-saving potentials.

#### Understanding Microgrids and Agent-Based Systems

Microgrids operate as small-scale energy systems that can function independently or in conjunction with the main power grid. They typically integrate various DERs and storage systems to supply energy in a localized manner. However, managing these systems requires sophisticated control mechanisms to ensure reliability and efficiency.

A Multi-Agent System (MAS) consists of autonomous agents that interact and make decisions to achieve specific goals. In the context of microgrids, these agents represent different components such as generators, loads, and control units. By coordinating their actions, MAS can optimize the operation of microgrids, ensuring that energy demands are met efficiently.

#### Configuration of the Microgrid

The proposed microgrid includes key components: PV arrays, fuel cells, electrolyzers, hydrogen tanks, and PHEV charging stations. Each component plays a critical role in ensuring a steady energy supply and efficient storage management.

1. **Photovoltaic Arrays**: These are the primary sources of renewable energy, converting solar radiation into electrical power. Their output depends on factors like solar irradiance and the efficiency of the PV cells.
   
2. **Fuel Cells**: These devices generate electricity through the chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. They serve as backup power sources when solar power is insufficient.

3. **Electrolyzers and Hydrogen Tanks**: Electrolyzers use excess electricity from PV arrays to produce hydrogen, which is stored in tanks. This hydrogen can later be used by fuel cells to generate electricity.

4. **PHEV Charging Stations**: These stations charge electric vehicles using available power from the microgrid. Coordinating the charging schedules of multiple vehicles is crucial to avoid overloading the system during peak hours.

#### Multi-Agent System Architecture

The MAS architecture proposed consists of five distinct agents:

1. **Generation Agent (GA)**: Manages the PV arrays and fuel cells, ensuring optimal power generation and hydrogen production/storage.

2. **Electrical Load Agent (LA)**: Aggregates the energy consumption data of the office building, excluding PHEV charging demands.

3. **PHEV Charging Station Agent (SA)**: Manages the charging schedules of PHEVs, ensuring they are charged efficiently and cost-effectively.

4. **Control Agent (CA)**: Coordinates the interactions between the GA, LA, and SA, ensuring that power generation and consumption are balanced.

5. **Design Agent (DA)**: Determines the optimal sizes of the microgrid components using particle swarm optimization (PSO), a technique that iteratively improves candidate solutions based on defined objectives.

### Simulation and Results

The effectiveness of the MAS was tested through simulations conducted using MATLAB, focusing on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf. Two scenarios were considered:

1. **Scenario 1**: PHEV charging demands were treated as fixed loads. The results showed that the total system cost was $1,639,700.

2. **Scenario 2**: PHEV charging demands were treated as deferrable loads, allowing for flexible scheduling. This scenario resulted in a lower total system cost of $1,571,900.

The simulations highlighted the cost-saving potential of using MAS for optimal sizing. By allowing flexible charging schedules, the system could reduce the number of required PV arrays and increase the utilization of EVSEs and hydrogen storage, ultimately lowering overall costs.

### Conclusion

The development of a Multi-Agent System for optimal sizing of commercial complex microgrids presents a promising approach to enhancing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of renewable energy integration. By leveraging intelligent control mechanisms and flexible energy management strategies, microgrids can better meet the dynamic demands of modern energy consumers.

The MAS proposed by Mohseni and Tafreshi not only ensures reliable energy supply but also offers significant cost savings by optimizing the sizing and operation of microgrid components. Future research and implementation of such systems could further contribute to achieving sustainable energy goals and reducing global carbon footprints.
