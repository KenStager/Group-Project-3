## Augmenting Agent Platforms to Facilitate Conversation Reasoning

### Introduction

In the sophisticated realm of Multi Agent Systems (MAS), the importance of effective communication cannot be overstated. Communication in MAS is the backbone that allows agents to cooperate, coordinate, and share knowledge efficiently. The language that facilitates this communication is known as Agent Communication Languages (ACLs). However, despite the critical role of these languages, the ability for agents to reason about their conversations remains limited. This is where the Agent Communication Reasoning Engine (ACRE) comes into play, aiming to enhance the existing capabilities of agent programming languages by integrating advanced conversation reasoning. This blog post will delve into the intricacies of ACRE, its implementation within the Agent Factory framework, and its potential future applications.

### Understanding Multi Agent Systems Communication

In MAS, agents interact using individual messages, which can sometimes be disjointed and lack context. An alternative and more structured approach involves grouping related messages into conversations, defined as "task-oriented, shared sequences of messages to accomplish specific tasks, such as negotiation or an auction." This structured approach not only streamlines communication but also aids in achieving shared objectives more effectively.

### The Role of ACRE

The Agent Communication Reasoning Engine (ACRE) is designed to address the limitations of existing communication methods in MAS. ACRE extends the logical reasoning capabilities of agent programming languages by enabling reasoning about complex interaction protocols. This enhancement allows for better tracking and understanding of conversations between agents. Currently in its initial prototype stage, ACRE has been integrated into the Agent Factory multi-agent framework, showcasing its potential to revolutionize agent communication.

### Exploring Related Work

Two primary standards in ACLs have been widely adopted: Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) and FIPA ACL. Both standards offer frameworks for basic communication between agents, but they fall short in supporting complex interactions. For instance, while FIPA ACL defines a minimal set of performatives necessary for communication, it also introduces interaction protocols to handle more sophisticated exchanges like information requests and auction protocols. However, the native support for these protocols within agent toolkits and frameworks remains sparse. Systems like JADE and Jason provide some level of support, but the full potential of interaction protocols is yet to be realized comprehensively.

### ACRE's Comprehensive Solution

ACRE aims to fill this gap by offering a robust system for modeling, managing, and reasoning about complex interactions using defined protocols and conversations. Here's a closer look at the key features that make ACRE a game-changer:

#### Protocol Definitions

Protocols in ACRE are defined in a shareable language, typically XML, that all agents understand. This clear separation between protocol definitions and their implementation simplifies communication and facilitates external monitoring tools.

#### Shared Ontologies

A shared vocabulary or ontology is crucial for agents to understand each other. ACRE ensures that agents can reason about the concepts being communicated, paving the way for more sophisticated interactions.

#### Plan Repository

Agents can access a repository of shareable plans, enabling them to learn new capabilities from one another. This feature is particularly useful for executing actions based on received communications, enhancing the overall efficiency of the MAS.

### Practical Applications of ACRE

One of the principal aims of ACRE is to facilitate the external monitoring of interaction protocols. By matching conversations and recognizing interaction patterns, developers can debug and ensure protocol adherence. Furthermore, ACRE enhances internal conversation reasoning, allowing agents to identify and follow protocols dynamically. This capability is crucial for maintaining organized and effective communication in scenarios where protocol identifiers may be missing.

### Conversation Management with ACRE

ACRE models protocols as finite state machines (FSMs), where each state transition is triggered by specific messages. This structured approach allows for precise tracking and management of conversations. Conversations, protocols, and messages are represented by tuples, and the system uses these tuples to match incoming messages with ongoing conversations, advancing the conversation state as appropriate.

### Example: The Vickrey Auction Protocol

To illustrate how ACRE manages conversations, consider the Vickrey Auction protocol. In this protocol, states and transitions are defined using an XML format. The initial state begins with a "call for proposals" (cfp) message, leading to subsequent states based on the responses received. Each transition is carefully monitored and managed, ensuring that the conversation adheres to the defined protocol.

### Integrating ACRE into the Agent Factory

The integration of ACRE into the Agent Factory framework showcases its practical application and potential benefits. The ACRE architecture consists of several components, including the Protocol Manager (PM) and the Conversation Manager (CM). The PM is responsible for loading and managing protocols, while the CM tracks ongoing conversations, ensuring they progress according to the defined protocols. The Agent/ACRE Interface (AAI) further facilitates interaction between agents and the ACRE components, providing essential information and enabling advanced communication capabilities.

### Conclusion and Future Work

The introduction of ACRE marks a significant advancement in facilitating conversation reasoning within MAS. While currently integrated into the Agent Factory, future efforts will focus on extending ACRE's capabilities to other frameworks and languages. Enhancements such as grouping related conversations and leveraging CM data for advanced reasoning will further elevate the efficiency and effectiveness of MAS communication. By bridging the gap between basic messaging and complex interaction protocols, ACRE paves the way for more intelligent and cooperative agent systems.
