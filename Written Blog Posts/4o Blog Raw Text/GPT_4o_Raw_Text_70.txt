# Exploring Fully Controllable Agents in Path Planning Using Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning

Navigating from point A to point B may seem straightforward to us humans, but for an autonomous agent, the task is immensely complex. The field of path planning, which involves finding an optimal route from a starting point to a target point, is crucial in various applications such as robotics, drones, military services, and self-driving cars. This blog post delves into a groundbreaking reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to create fully controllable agents capable of achieving multiple goals in dynamic environments, even those never visited during training.

## Introduction

Imagine a world where autonomous robots or drones can not only reach predefined destinations but can also adapt and achieve multiple, dynamically set goals. Traditional path planning methods often limit agents to a single, user-defined goal, leading to constrained operational flexibility. However, a recent study proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework that allows for a fully controllable agent in path planning scenarios. By leveraging bi-directional memory editing and a sub-goals dedicated network, this innovative approach significantly enhances the agent's adaptability and efficiency.

## The Need for Fully Controllable Agents

### Traditional Limitations

Most existing path planning models focus on achieving a single, predetermined goal. While this approach is effective for straightforward tasks, it falls short in dynamic environments where multiple goals may arise. For example, a search-and-rescue drone may need to navigate through various checkpoints before reaching its final destination. Traditional models lack the flexibility to adapt to such scenarios, limiting their practical utility.

### The New Approach

The new RL framework addresses these limitations by introducing a bi-directional memory editing technique and a sub-goals dedicated network. These elements enable the agent to learn various trajectories and behaviors, making it capable of reaching multiple goals, including those not encountered during training. This fully controllable agent can perform complex tasks such as round trips and navigate through dynamically set sub-goals, significantly enhancing its utility in real-world applications.

## Bi-Directional Memory Editing

### Concept

Bi-directional memory editing involves creating both forward and reverse trajectories from the routes an agent has traveled. This technique allows the agent to learn various behaviors, improving its ability to navigate complex environments.

### Implementation

1. **Forward Memory Editing**: Generate sub-goals from the agent's forward route, then store these in a replay memory.
2. **Backward Memory Editing**: Predict reverse actions using an inverse module, generate the reverse trajectory, and store these in the replay memory.

This dual approach effectively doubles the agent's learning opportunities, enabling it to understand and navigate different paths more efficiently.

## Sub-Goals Dedicated Network

### Purpose

In path planning, an agent may be required to reach intermediate sub-goals before achieving the final goal. To manage this, a sub-goals dedicated network is employed, separate from the policy network.

### Benefits

1. **Improved Learning Efficiency**: The sub-goals dedicated network focuses solely on learning intermediate goals, thereby enhancing the agent's performance in complex tasks.
2. **Reduced Confusion**: By separating the learning of sub-goals from the main policy network, the agent can avoid confusion when multiple paths are possible.

## Reward Shaping for Shorter Paths

### Importance

In path planning, reaching the destination in the shortest possible time is often crucial. Reward shaping helps achieve this by providing additional incentives for following shorter paths.

### Method

The additional rewards are calculated based on the difference between the shortest possible steps and the steps actually taken by the agent. This approach encourages the agent to find and follow more efficient routes.

## Experimental Validation

### Simple 2D Grid Environment

In a simplified 2D grid environment, the agent was trained to reach a target point from a starting point. The study tested various scenarios, including complex setups where the starting and target points were reversed.

1. **Without Sub-Goals**: The agent easily reached the target point but showed limited flexibility.
2. **With Sub-Goals**: The agent successfully navigated through multiple sub-goals, including round trips and previously unseen areas, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability.

### Key-Door Domain

In this more complex environment, the agent had to navigate through four stages, passing bonus points before reaching the final goal. The agent trained with the new RL framework successfully completed the tasks, even when the scenarios were dynamically altered.
