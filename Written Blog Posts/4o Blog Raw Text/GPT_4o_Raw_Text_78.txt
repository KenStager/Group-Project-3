# DCIR: Dynamic Consistency Intrinsic Reward for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a crucial technique employed in a variety of practical applications such as robotic control, video games, and autonomous vehicles. These systems require multiple agents to interact and cooperate with each other to achieve a common goal. However, one of the persistent challenges in MARL is determining the optimal behavior policy for each agent. This challenge is particularly pronounced when it comes to deciding whether two agents should exhibit consistent behaviors. In this article, we delve into a novel approach called Dynamic Consistency Intrinsic Reward (DCIR), which addresses this issue.

## Introduction

Imagine a scenario where multiple robots are working together to complete a task, such as delivering packages within a warehouse. Each robot is an independent agent that needs to learn the optimal way to navigate and deliver packages efficiently. However, this becomes complex as the number of robots increases. The difficulty is further exacerbated in real-world scenarios where the external rewards for each agent are often sparse and delayed. Assigning appropriate rewards to each agent is crucial for encouraging them to organize their behaviors effectively for successful collaboration. This is where DCIR comes into play.

## Key Concept: Behavior Consistency

Before we delve into DCIR, it’s essential to understand the concept of behavior consistency. In MARL, behavior consistency is defined as the divergence in output actions between two agents when provided with the same observation. For instance, if two robots see the same obstacle and decide to navigate around it in the same way, their behavior is consistent. Conversely, if one robot decides to go around the obstacle while the other attempts to go over it, their behaviors are inconsistent.

## Dynamic Consistency Intrinsic Reward (DCIR)

### 1. **Defining Behavior Consistency**

DCIR begins by defining behavior consistency as the KL divergence between the action distributions of two agents given the same observation. The KL divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. In this context, it reflects the agents' intentions. If two agents have similar actions, their KL divergence is low, indicating high behavior consistency.

### 2. **Introducing Intrinsic Rewards**

The core idea of DCIR is to use intrinsic rewards to encourage agents to be aware of each other’s behaviors. An intrinsic reward is an internal reward signal that motivates the agent to behave in a certain way, independent of the external rewards provided by the environment. In DCIR, agents receive higher intrinsic rewards when their behaviors align with an optimal consistency level, which can either be consistent or inconsistent based on situational requirements.

### 3. **Dynamic Scale Network (DSN)**

To dynamically adjust the level of consistency required, DCIR employs a Dynamic Scale Network (DSN). DSN calculates learnable scale factors for each agent at every time step. These scale factors guide whether to reward consistent behavior and determine the magnitude of the intrinsic rewards. This approach allows agents to adaptively decide whether to behave consistently with other agents, depending on the context.

## Experimental Results

To evaluate the efficacy of DCIR, extensive experiments were conducted in several environments, including Multi-agent Particle, Google Research Football, and StarCraft II Micromanagement.

### 1. **Cooperative Tasks**

In cooperative tasks like Cooperative Navigation and Heterogeneous Navigation, DCIR significantly outperforms other baseline methods. For instance, in a Cooperative Navigation task, where agents need to reach individual goals as quickly as possible, DCIR ensures that agents dynamically choose consistent or inconsistent behaviors, thereby avoiding conflicts and improving overall efficiency.

### 2. **Competitive Tasks**

DCIR also excels in competitive tasks with adversaries. In scenarios like Physical Deception and Predator-Prey, where agents need to either deceive adversaries or capture prey, DCIR helps agents decide when to coordinate their behaviors consistently or inconsistently to outperform adversarial agents. For example, in a Keep-Away task, DCIR demonstrated an 89.99% improvement over the best baseline method by efficiently dividing roles among agents.

## Conclusion

DCIR presents a significant advancement in multi-agent reinforcement learning by addressing the dynamic behavior consistency issue. By leveraging intrinsic rewards and a dynamic scale network, DCIR enables agents to adaptively decide on their behavior consistency, leading to more efficient and effective collaboration. While DCIR offers promising results, future work could explore more complex scenarios and further enhance the interpretability of agent behaviors.
