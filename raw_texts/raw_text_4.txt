Abstractâ We introduce an activeâpassive networked multi-
agent system framework, which consists of agents subject to
exogenous inputs (active agents) and agents without any inputs
(passive agents), and analyze its convergence using Lyapunov
stability.

A. Preliminaries

In the multiagent literature, graphs are broadly adopted
to encode interactions in networked systems [1], [2]. An
undirected graph G is deï¬ned by a set VG = {1, . . . , n} of
nodes and a set EG â VG Ã VG of edges. If (i, j) â EG, then
the nodes i and j are neighbors and the neighboring relation
is indicated with i â¼ j. The degree of a node is given by the
number of its neighbors. Letting di be the degree of node i,
then the degree matrix of a graph G, D(G) â RnÃn, is given
by D(G) , diag(d), d = [d1, . . . , dn]T. A path i0i1 . . . iL is
a ï¬nite sequence of nodes such that ikâ1 â¼ ik, k = 1, . . . , L,
and a graph G is connected if there is a path between any
pair of distinct nodes. The adjacency matrix of a graph G,
A(G) â RnÃn, is given by

[A(G)]ij ,

if (i, j) â EG,

1,
0, otherwise.

The Laplacian matrix of a graph, L(G) â S nÃn
+ , playing a
central role in many graph theoretic treatments of multiagent
systems, is given by

L(G) , D(G) â A(G).

Throughout this note, we model a given multiagent system
by a connected, undirected graph G, where nodes and edges
represent agents and inter-agent communication links, re-
spectively.

B. Problem Formulation

Consider a system of n agents exchanging information
among each other using their local measurements according
to a connected, undirected graph G. In addition, consider that

there exists m â¥ 1 exogenous inputs that interact with this
system. We make the following deï¬nitions.

Deï¬nition 1. If agent i, i = 1, . . . , n, is subject to one or
more exogenous inputs (resp., no exogenous inputs), then it
is an active agent (resp., passive agent).

Deï¬nition 2. If an exogenous input interacts with only
one agent (resp., multiple agents), then it is an isolated input

(resp., non-isolated input).

In this note, we are interested in the problem of driving

the states of all (active and passive) agents to the average
of the applied exogenous inputs. Motivating from this stand-

point, we propose an integral action-based distributed control
approach given by

(cid:17)

where xi(t) â R and Î¾i(t) â R denote the state and the
integral action of agent i, i = 1, . . . , n, respectively, and
ch â R, h = 1, . . . , m, denotes an exogenous input applied
to this agent. Similar to the i â¼ j notation indicating the
neighboring relation between agents, we use i â¼ h to indicate
the exogenous inputs that an agent is subject to.

the state of all agents xi(t), i = 1, . . . , n asymptotically
converge to Ç«.

Theorem 1. Consider the networked multiagent system

given by (3) and (4), where agents exchange information
using local measurements and with G deï¬ning a connected,
undirected graph topology. Then, the closed-loop error dy-
namics deï¬ned by (16) and (17) are Lyapunov stable for all
initial conditions and Î´(t) asymptotically vanishes.

Proof. Proof follows by considering Lyapunov function

candidate given by V (Î´, e) = 1
ing it along the trajectories of (16) and (17).

D. Concluding Remarks

(19)

We investigated a system consisting of agents subject to
exogenous constant inputs and agents without any inputs.

Future research will consider extensions to time-varying
exogenous inputs and more general graph topologies.
