Abstract 

Teachable  agents  are  computer  agents  based  on  the  pedagogical  concept  of  learning-by-

teaching. During the tutoring process, where students take on the role of the tutor to teach 

a computer agent tutee, learners have been observed to gain deeper understanding of the 

subject  matter.  Teachable  agents  are  commonly  used  in  the  areas  of  science  and 

mathematics  learning  where  learners  are  able  to  learn  complex  concepts  and  deep 

reasoning by teaching the teachable agent through graphic representation such as concept 

maps. 

Literature  review  on  teachable  agents  as  well  as  observations  during  field  studies 

conducted  by  the  researcher,  have  shown  that  many  current  teachable  agents  lack  the 

interaction abilities required to keep learners engage in learning tasks. The result of this is 

learners  deviating  from  the  teaching  process,  and  thus  the  learners  are  unable  to  benefit 

fully  from  learning  with  the  teachable  agent.  The  applications  of  teachable  agents  are 

restricted to the learning of academic subjects such as mathematics and science. The rapidly 

aging  global  population  however  has  resulted  in  increased  interest  in  expanding  the 

applications  of  teachable  agents, 

in  order  to  utilize 

it  as  a  tool  to  encourage 

intergenerational bonding as well as to benefit wider group of users.  

In this thesis, we have proposed the Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA), a teachable 

agent based on the theoretical framework of persuasion, computational and goal-oriented 

agent modelling. Consequently, in this thesis we ask how the PTA can be used to encourage 

intergenerational learning among learners from different age groups. We argue that the PTA, 

an autonomous agent, capable of encouraging attitude and behavioural change can offer a 

more meaningful and engaging learning experiences for learners from different age groups. 

Based  on  the  findings  from  our  research  we  argue  that  persuasive  feedback  actions 

generated by the PTA provide significant influence over learnerâs decision to participate in 

intergenerational  learning.  The  PTA  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  development  of  future 

persuasive technologies in artificial intelligent agents.

1  Introduction  

Teachable agents are pedagogical agents that encourage students to learn through teaching 

the  agents.  The  development  of  teachable  agents  is  based  on  the  learning-by-teaching 

pedagogy  on  the  notion  that  students  learn  much  better  for  themselves  when  they  teach 

others. Teachable agents focus on life-like interaction between learners the tutoring process 

through verbal and visual simulation in order to motivate deeper learning, another area of 

research  in  developing agent  architecture  to  support  learning  (Biswas  & Leeawong, 2005). 

Teachable  agents  allow  for  learners  to  engage  in  tutoring  of  an  artificial  computer  agent, 

and  in  the  process  learners  are  able  to  learn  for  themselves  (Blair,  Schwartz,  Biswas,  & 

Leelawong, 2006). Thus, with teachable agents, learners are able to benefit from the ability 

to  acquire  inquiry  skills  through  asking  questions,  and  obtain  motivation  through  the 

cultivation  of  a  sense  of  responsibility  towards  their  peer  tutee.  Research  in  teachable 

agents has shown positive results in a learners ability to reflect on complex concepts while 

they teach the teachable agents, learners have also been observed to be receptive towards 

taking  on  the  responsibility  of  teaching  the  teachable  agent  and  therefore  learn  better  in 

the process  (Chase, Chin, Oppezzo, & Schwartz, 2009).    

Teachable  agents  are  applied  in  areas  of  education  and  learning  in  various  domains, 

such  as  science  and  mathematics,  have  demonstrated  positive  effects  in  helping  the 

students  gain  motivation,  increasing  self-regulated  learning  behaviours,  and  improving 

learning gains (Chase et al., 2009; Matsuda, Keiser, Raizada, Tu, et al., 2010; Pareto, Haake, 

LindstrÃ¶m, SjÃ¶dÃ©n, & Gulz, 2012).   

However, in our literature review of teachable agent systems, presented in Chapter 2, it 

is  shown  that  existing  teachable  agents  lack  social  interaction  causing  frustrations  among 

student users (Agneta Gulz, Haake, Silvervarg, SjÃ¶dÃ©n, & Veletsianos, 2011). As a result, they 

are  not  able  to  fully  engage  in  learning  with  the  teachable  agents.  Moreover,  current 

teachable  agents  developed  to  date  are  targeted  towards  students  in  schools,  and  are 

applied  in  specific  areas  of  education  and  learning  domains,  mainly  in  the  areas  of 

mathematics  (Carlson,  Keiser,  Matsuda,  Koedinger,  &  RosÃ©,  2012)  and  science  learning 

 
 
 
 
(Biswas & Leeawong, 2005). Therefore, there is a limit in the areas in which the teachable 

agents can be applied.    

The  aim  of  this  research  is  to  improve  on  existing  teachable  agent  by  resolving  the 

issues such as lack of  social interaction between learners and teachable agents. As well as 

expanding the application of teachable agents to benefit a wider group of learners.  

In order improve teachable agents in the way they interact with its users and to expand 

its application to a wider group of users, the Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA) is proposed 

in this research. The PTA is a novel teachable agent developed based on persuasion theory.  

By  introducing  persuasion  theory  into  existing  teachable  agent,  the  improved  PTA  will  be 

able  to  social  interact  with  different  groups  of  users,  such  that  users  from  different 

generations  are  able  to  come  together  in  an  environment  to  share  and  learn  from  the 

knowledge  taught  to  the  teachable  agent.  In  this  way,  a  wider  range  of  population  can 

benefit from the positive learning effects from teaching the teachable agent. 

  We  have  designed  the  PTA,  a  teachable  agent  with  persuasion  capabilities  to  support 

intergenerational  learning.  The  PTA  is  a  teachable  agent  that  understands  the  learning 

motivation  and  abilities  of 

individual  users 

in  the  process  of  tutoring  the  agent. 

Improvements are also made to the PTA to encourage social interaction with its users. The 

result  is  the  PTA  that  provides  autonomous  persuasive  feedback,  encouraging  learners  in 

teaching the agent.  

The  application  of  the  PTA  have  also  been  extended  to  support  intergenerational 

learning,  which  focus  on  building  bonds  and  fostering  interaction  between  the  young  and 

older generations. The learning by teaching pedagogy allows the inclusion of multiple tutors, 

and  thus  provides  a  way  to  motivate  cross-generation  learning,  and  thus  helping  them  to 

lead a more fulfilling life by learning and sharing their knowledge with learners form other 

generations. This also helps build strong relational bonds between the different generations 

of learners there are transferable resources with many social benefits that can be passed on 

between generations of learners.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Another area in which this research, the PTA, can improve intergenerational learning is 

through the use of technology. There is a potential digital divide between the younger and 

the older users. Younger generations who are born in the digital world coined the âDigital 

Nativesâ  are  comfortable  with  the  use  of  technology,  their  grandparents  or  parents  the 

âDigital Migrantsâ may not be able feel uneasy about adopting the new technology (Prensky, 

2001).  We  reason  that  through  collaborative  use,  technology  can  be  used  to  improve  the 

quality time families member spend with their children. 

To improve intergenerational relationships through technology and close the gap in the 

digital  divide,  teachable  agents  such  as  the  PTA  can  be  implemented  into  games  that 

designed to support intergeneration bonding. The âDigital Migrantsâ who may be adults or 

the  elderly  will  be  motivated  through  game  play,  learning  and  teaching,  to  participate  in 

intergenerational learning activities with the younger âDigital Nativesâ 

The  PTA  is  designed  based  on  teachable  agents  and  persuasion  theory.  Teachable 

agents  have  been  used  in  educating  young  learners  with  well-established  learning-by-

teaching  pedagogy.  Moreover,  traditional  teachable  agents  have  been  widely  studied  in 

previous research, and demonstrating positive results in encouraging self-regulated learning, 

the  ProtÃ©gÃ©  Effect,  and  is  already used  for  a number  of both  competitive  and  cooperative 

games (Chase et al., 2009; Matsuda et al., 2012; Pareto et al., 2012). Teachable agents such 

as  the  PTA  can  be  used  to  motivate  intergenerational  learning  among  the  different 

generations.  

In  this  thesis,  the  researcher  hopes  to  contribute  to  a  future  where  the  use  of 

technology such as the PTA can help to encourage children to spend more time with their 

parents and grandparents, as well as encourage the younger generation to interact with the 

older cohort.  

1.1  Research Objectives 

As  the  population ages and  with extended  life expectancy, there  is  an urgency to develop 

systems to cater to the learning needs of the growing elderly population. One of the aims of 

this research is to support communities in the transmission of social capital, and continuing  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of  lifelong  learning  across  generations.  The  global  demographic  shift  towards  a  growing 

elderly population has driven our research in the application of teachable agents to cater to 

aging learners. 

Based  on  the  literature  review,  there  are  limitations  in  current  teachable  agents 

systems such as the lack of social interaction between teachable agents and the inability for 

the teachable agents to assess the learners. At the same time, the literature review has also 

shown  that  teachable  agents  have  been  known  to  improve  learning  in  young  learning  in 

science  and  mathematics  learning  domains.  There  is  however,  a  research  gap  in  the 

application of teachable agents in intergenerational learning scenarios. Hence, the following 

are the research objectives within the scope of this research.  

1.  Overcome existing issues in teachable agents. 

The  first  and  foremost  objective  of  this  research  is  to  address  the  current  issue  in 

teachable  agents,  where  the  literature  review  on  current  teachable  agents  have  revealed 

that teachable agents the lack capability to keep learners interested in teaching and learning 

with  the  agent.  Therefore,  the  focus  is  to  improve  the  teachable  agent,  so  as  keep  the 

learners interested in learning and teaching the teachable agent.  

2.  Design  of  PTA  to  infuse  persuasion  theory  in  teachable  agents  to  encourage 

learning. 

The  next  objective  following  the  identification  of  issues  in  teachable  agent  systems  is 

the design of a teachable agent system that is able to understands userâs learning ability and 

motivation, so that PTA will be able to influence learnerâs attitude and behaviour in learning 

and teaching. With this aim in mind, the theory of persuasion is examined as it provides a 

framework to  provide the necessary  influence  in  improving the  learning  experience  of the 

learners when they interact with the agent.  

3.  Implementation of PTA for intergenerational learning. 

 Current teachable agent systems are applied in specific learning domains such as math 

and  science.  This  research  aims  to  expand  the  application  of  PTA  to  areas  of  informal 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
learning, so as to benefit wider groups users. At the same time, the PTA provides a platform 

in  which  knowledge  from  different  age  groups  can  be  shared  in  an  intergenerational 

learning setting.  

4.  Testing and evaluation of PTA for intergenerational learning 

The objective of this research also covers the testing and evaluation of the PTA in terms 

the  effects  of  intergeneration  learning  to  benefit  the  future  works  on  teachable  agent 

research.  

1.2  Research Questions and Hypotheses 

Given  the  background  of  this  research,  the  following  are  the  research  questions  and 

hypotheses that will be tested in this thesis.  

Question 1: What are intergenerational learning experiences during the interaction with the 

PTA? 

Hypothesis 1:  

In this hypothesis, it is predicted that the participants from different age groups will benefit 

from  intergenerational  learning  events  such  as  taking  on  various  roles  such  as  teacher, 

student,  leader  and  follower  in  the  course  of  teaching  the  PTA.  Some  other  possible 

intergenerational learning experiences include skills and knowledge areas such as computer 

skills, school related issues or academic knowledge.  

Question2: How do different age groups perceive the PTA during intergenerational learning?  

Hypothesis 2:  

Teachable  agents  have  shown  to  benefit  learners  by  producing  the  ProtÃ©gÃ©  Effect,  where 

they  are  motivated  to  learning  better  for  themselves  by  taking  on  the  role  of  the  teacher 

and teaching a novice learner. With the PTA, we predict that the difference in effort towards 

learning for different age groups will be greater for the older age group.  

Question 3: Does PTA improve learning across different age groups? 

 
 
 
 
Hypothesis 3: 

Our hypothesis is that intergenerational learning increases the time spent teaching the PTA, 

and allow for greater interaction between participants from different age groups.  

Question  4:  How  can  the  findings  from  the  study  help  in  the  future  design  of  PTA  for 

intergenerational learning? 

Hypothesis 4:  

The  findings  from  the  study  in  this  thesis  will  be  useful  to  the  future  development  of 

teachable  agents,  particularly  in  expanding  the  application  of  teachable  agents  to  other 

aspects of learning such as informal learning and non-academic subjects, as well as towards 

the application of teachable agents for different age groups. 

1.3  Organization of Report 

In the first section of the report we have introduced the rationale for the research in PTA for 

intergenerational  learning,  which  is  first  and  foremost  to  overcome  the  existing  issues  in 

teachable  agents  and  to  expand  its  application  from  classroom  learning  topics  such  as 

science  and  mathematics  domain,  to  informal  learning  towards  building  intergenerational 

learning relationship. 

The  following  Chapter  2  of  this  paper  introduces  artificial  intelligence  and  agent 

technology,  followed  by  a  literature  review  on  teachable  agent  as  a  pedagogical  agent 

introducing  related  work  on  teachable  agents  in  supporting  classroom  learning  that 

compares  the  key  capabilities  of  different  teachable  agent  systems,  highlighting  issues  of 

different  teachable  agent  systems  in  current  research.  The  second  part  of  the  literature 

review  examines  the  various  persuasive  theories  that  are  used  in  social  psychology  to 

influence attitudes. And discuss on how persuasion can be used in computer interaction to 

generate  positive  attitudes  in  users  of  systems.  The  final  part  of  the  literature  review  will 

touch on intergenerational learning with case studies which introduce programmes initiated 

by  various  agencies  to  promote  learning  among  the  different  generations  to  encourage 

bonding.    

 
 
 
 
The  Chapter  3  of  the  paper  focuses  on  the  current  work  in  the  initial  design  and 

development of  PTA.  A preliminary  experiment  was  conducted  to test the  initial design  of 

PTA and issues and challenges regarding our initial design will be discussed.  

In Chapter 4 of this report, the actual implementation of the PTA in the latest improved 

version Virtual Singapura (VS) Saga, a 3D virtual learning platform will be introduced. A user 

study on the effectiveness PTA for intergenerational learning and the results and findings of 

the study will be discussed.   

 Lastly, Chapter 5 is the conclusion highlighting the contributions in the current work on 

PTA,  and  the  report  ends  with  the  future  work 

in 

implementation  of  PTA  for 

intergenerational learning. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
2  Literature Review  

The  first  section  of  the  literature  review  introduces  the  works  on  the  pedagogical 

foundation  of  teachable  agents.  The  development  of  teachable  agents  is  traced  from  the 

root of computer aided learning with intelligent learning systems. Different teachable agent 

systems are also compared in terms of the domain in which they are applied and analysis of 

the capabilities and drawbacks of each teachable agent is included. 

The literature review will also examine various persuasion theories in social psychology 

used to  change  individual  opinion  and attitudes  on  specific  subject  matter.  The  discussion 

section will describe how the persuasion theories aim to counter the drawbacks in current 

teachable agent systems.  

Lastly,  the  literature  review  looks  into  the  works  on  intergenerational  learning,  a 

relatively new domain which proposes that the teachable agent can be applied to benefit a 

wider user group of different ages. 

2.1  Teachable Agents 

Teachable  agents  are  pedagogical  agents  through  which  students  engage  in  learning 

through teaching the agents. The development of teachable agents is based on the learning-

by-teaching pedagogy on the notion that students learn much better for themselves when 

they teach others. 

There  are  several  areas  of  research  developments  in  teachable  agents,  the  first  area 

focuses  on  life-like  interaction  between  learners  and  agent  during  the  tutoring  process 

through verbal and visual simulation in order to motivate deeper learning. Another area of 

research  is  the  development  of  an  agent  architecture  to  support  learning  (Biswas  & 

Leeawong,  2005).  Teachable  agents  allow  for  student  learners  to  engage  in  tutoring  of  an 

artificial  computer  agent,  and  in  the  process  student  learners  are  able  to  learn  for 

themselves (Blair et al., 2006). Thus, with teachable agents, learners are able to benefit from 

the  ability acquire  inquiry  skills  in  asking  questions,  and  motivate  learners  by cultivating  a 

sense of responsibility towards their peer tutee. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.1 Development of Teachable Agents 

Computers  have  a  history  of  being  used  to  support  learning.  Computer  Aided  Instruction 

Systems (CAI systems) which are used to scaffold learning has its roots traced to Presseyâs 

1925 instructional system, which was made up of a punch-board device and multiple-choice 

machine  (Mann,  2008).  The  disadvantage  of  the  traditional  CAI  system  is  that  it  requires 

learners  to  memorize  learning  materials  repeatedly,  which  decreases  student  interest  and 

motivation in learning (Arnold, 2000). This led to the emergence of Artificial Intelligence in 

Education (AIED) and the development of the intelligent learning environment (ILE) where 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) are used in CAI systems to support learning, which improving the 

interaction experience between learners and system learning (Blandford, 1994). 

  Within the ILE, there is the Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) which tends to imitate the 

process  of  human  to  human  tutoring  by  replacing  human  tutors  with  computer  (Chan  & 

Baskin, 1990). There are also advocates of alternate learning models (Self, 1990) whom have 

inspired  researchers  to  investigate  alternative  methods  of  teaching  such  as  mimicking  the 

teaching process in traditional classroom within the ITS. For example, Chan and Baskin (1990) 

used the learning-by-teaching model to develop an ITS where multiple agents takes on the 

role of the teacher and learning companion (Chan & Baskin, 1990).  

DENISE system (Nichols, 1993) is an  ITS that was developed to support the learning of 

Economics using the learning-by-teaching pedagogy. The DENISE system  aims to  improve 

the cognitive and motivational aspects of learning by allowing learners to construct causal 

relations  using  question  and  answer  dialogue  sequences  where  student  learners  takes  on 

the role of the tutor teaching the computer. However, the lack of natural interaction caused 

learnerâs frustration (Nichols, 1994).  

To  simulate  a  more  naturalistic  interaction  between  learners  and  system,  a  branch  of 

research  has  focused  on  developing  learning  companion  agents  to  increase  learnerâs 

attention  and  keeping  human  learners  motivated  in  learning  (Chan  &  Baskin,  1990). 

EduAgent  is  one  such  learning  environment  that  incorporates  an  artificial  learning 

companion in learning Mathematics developed to accompany learners with different levels 

of  competencies  and  to  engage  in  meaningful  conversation  with  learners  (Hietala  & 

 
 
 
 
 
Niemirepo,  1998).  With  the  development  of  systems  such  as  EduAgent,  there  was  an 

interest in studying the motivation for student to learn with learning companions. Thus, it is 

suggested that not only does the level of competency of the learning companion matters to 

how  well  the  collaboration  between  human  learner  and  learning  companion,  but  that  the 

personality  and  ability  of  individual  learners  should  also  affect  the  way  the  learning 

companion  communicates  with  the  human  learner  in  keeping  them  motivated  in  learning 

(Hietala & Niemirepo, 1998; Uresti, 2000). 

At  MIT  Lab,  âLearning  Companionâ  was  built  to  recognize  a  learnerâs  emotion  and  to 

provide intervention in order to guide students towards productive learning tasks (Cooper, 

Brna,  &  Martins,  2000;  Kapoor,  Mota,  &  Picard,  2001).  Virtual  agents  that  are    based  on 

learning-by-teaching  pedagogy  were  integrated  into  Computer  Aided  Instruction  System 

(CAI system) to help learners to learn more effectively (Fumiaki, Hiroshi, & Hidekazu, 2000).  

Countering the drawbacks of monotonous learning in CAI systems and to maximize the 

potential  benefits  of  learning-by-teaching  pedagogy,  teachable  agents  are  developed  to 

improve student learners learning experience when tutoring the embodiment of an artificial 

intelligence  learning  companion.  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  allows  computers  and  machines 

to  make  human-liked  decisions,  solve  problems  accordingly,  therefore  enabling  them  to 

perceive  reason  and  act  humanly  and  rationally  (Russell  &  Norvig,  2009).  An  intelligent 

agent  is  an  autonomous  computer  agent  that  acts  or  operates  in  an  environment  with 

reasoning and learning based on observation through sensors to achieve certain goals. 

  With  the  integration  of  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  teachable  agents  are  developed  to 

improve  student  learning  by  providing  adaptable  learning  environment,  tailored  to  an 

individual  learnerâs  needs  and  capability.  In  a  teachable  agent  learning  environment, 

student learners are expected to explicitly teach the agent to carry out complicated learning 

tasks (Biswas, Schwartz, & Bransford, 2001).    

Betty is a teachable agent developed by G. Biwas and colleagues at âAAA labâ, Stanford 

University and âTeachable Agent Groupâ at Vanderbilt University (Biswas & Leeawong, 2005; 

Blair  et  al.,  2006)  to  be  used  in  the  domain  of  science  topics.  Learners  teach  the  Betty 

teachable  agent  by  modifying  concept  maps  (Novak,  1990).  By  linking  relations  between 

 
 
 
 
 
concepts, visual representations of knowledge and reasoning mechanisms. The central idea 

of science topics is made clear to the learners with the use of concept maps. With the Betty 

teachable agent, learners are able to evaluate the progress of Bettyâs learning by observing 

the agentâs explanation to a problem. 

  Within the Bettyâs Brain system, the âProtÃ©gÃ© Effectâ (Chase et al., 2009) was observed 

where  learners  take  on  responsibility  for  their  teachable  agent,  and  therefore,  believing 

they  were  learning  for  their  tutees,  learners  were  willing  to  put  significantly  more  effort 

towards learning and benefited from the enhanced Betty.  

The Betty system  learns using hidden Markov models (HMM)  (Rabiner & Juang, 1986) 

generated from student behaviour activity logs to measure self-regulated learning based on 

learning  behaviour  in  a  learnerâs  associated  activities.  According  to  established  studies  in 

cognitive science, self-regulatory and meta-cognitive skills are beneficial to students beyond 

classroom learning (Zimmerman, 1990), learners become better students for future learning, 

displaying  autonomy  and  control even  when they  no  longer have  access  to  self-regulation 

learning  environment  (Leelawong  &  Biswas,  2008).  The  results  conducted  on  the  Bettyâs 

Brain  system  demonstrate  that  learners  show  better  learning  performance  and  meta-

cognitive  behaviours  than  those  who  only  learn  for  themselves.  With  meta-cognitive 

feedback  from  the  mentor  agent  while  teaching  the  teachable  agent,  learners  display 

advance  focus  and  monitoring  behaviours  (Biswas,  Jeong,  Kinnebrew,  Sulcer,  &  Roscoe, 

2010).  

SimStudent  is  another  teachable  agent  developed  at  Carnegie  University.  The  original 

goal  of  SimStudent  was  to  facilitate  authoring  of  cognitive  tutors,  a  learning-by-tutored 

problem  system  which  simulates  classroom 

instructional  environment 

in  teaching 

mathematics.  The  system  acts  out  the  role  of  the  teacher  providing  learners  with 

information (Matsuda, Cohen, Sewall, Lacerda, & Koedinger, 2007).  The first and foremost 

reason for setting up a teachable agent in SimStudent is that it would take up a lot time for 

students to wait for their turn to teach and learn from each other. A teachable agent would 

allow  students  to  teach  the  agent  and  simulate  the  learning-by-teaching  environment. 

Secondly,  in  actual  person  to  person  tutoring,  the  tutees  may  not  benefit  as  much  as  the 

 
 
 
 
 
tutor  (Matsuda,  Keiser,  Raizada,  Tu,  et  al.,  2010).  SimStudent  is  incorporated  into  APLUS 

(Artificial  Peer  Learning  environment),  where  learners  are  able  to  tutor  SimStudent  the 

artificial  peer  learner    in  a  learning-by-teaching  environment  (Matsuda,  Keiser,  Raizada, 

Stylianides, et al., 2010). 

 SimStudent  is  a  machine  learning  agent  that  has  the  potential  to  predict  a  human 

learnerâs performance. When learners are faced with new problems, SimStudent is able to 

observe the cognitive skills used by the learners, so as to extract a cognitive model, which it 

uses  to  explain  solutions  to  learners.  The  concept  of  the  teachable  agent  environment  in 

SimStudent  is  to  build  a  platform  to  support  the  learning-by-teaching  pedagogy,  while 

keeping  the  cost  of  setting  up  such  an  environment  low  to  counter  the  drawbacks  of 

conducting peer tutoring in classrooms. 

Subsequently,  the  developments  of  pedagogy  agents  have  been  directed  towards 

studies to explore the cognitive, affective and social aspects of interaction between learners 

and agents (Kim & Baylor, 2006). This led to the incorporation of personality traits in visual 

representation  and  conversational  ability  in  teachable  agents.  Using  EnALI  (Enhancing 

Agent-Learner  Interaction)  (Veletsianos,  Miller,  &  Doering,  2009)  as  a  guiding  framework 

and an existing teachable agent learning environment,  SjÃ¶dÃ©n and colleagues developed a 

system which included teachable agent with added social and conversational abilities. The 

study  on  the  system  concluded  the  importance  of  agent  context,  learner  knowledge  and 

understanding  the  way  learners  communicate  (SjÃ¶dÃ©n,  Silvervarg,  Veletsianos,  Haake,  & 

Gulz, 2011).  

2.1.2 Progress in Teachable Agent Research 

Improvements on Bettyâs Brain system has been made to explore the relationship between 

teachable agent feedback and learnerâs performance in the system. Agent prompts in Betty 

Brain  are designed to  encourage  reflective  interaction  (Wu  &  Looi,  2008).  It  is  shown that 

dialogue  and  action  responsiveness has  strong relations to  the  learning  gain  in the  Bettyâs 

Brain  system.  Hence,  cognitive  and  metacognitive  models  for  effective  self-regulated 

learning  is  compared  to  student  learning  strategy  to  derive  feedback  for  students  to 

overcome learning difficulties (James R. Segedy, John S. Kinnebrew, & Gautam Biswas, 2011). 

 
 
 
 
 
On  the  other  hand,  SimStudent  has  included  a  natural  language  interaction  between  the 

learner  and  the  teachable  agent  (Carlson  et  al.,  2012).  Text  classification  is  used  to  train 

models  in  order  to  differentiate  and  categorize  learnerâs  feedback  and  enable  interaction 

between learners and teachable agent. 

Attempts  have  also  been  made  to  improve  the  believability  of  teachable  agents  by 

simulating  emotions  and  modes  of  empathetic  expression 

in 

immersive 

learning 

environments  with  the  integration  Affective  Computing  (Picard,  1997).  Teachable  agents 

that  can  express  emotions  as  a  result  of  a  learnerâs  interaction  are  often  introduced  as 

affective teachable agents. The purpose of an affective teachable agent is to evoke learnerâs 

interest in tutoring the agent.  

Affective  teachable  agent  was  introduced  in  a  Virtual  Learning  Environment  (VLE), 

Virtual  Singapura  (VS)  for  Lower  Secondary  Science  learning  in  Singapore  designed  with 

goal-oriented  reasoning,  categorizing  a  set  of  emotions  based  on  the  Ortony  Clore  Collins 

(OCC)  model  (Ortony,  Clore,  &  Collins, 1990).  OCC allows  the  teachable  agent  to  generate 

appropriate emotional responses based on what the students have taught the agent (Ailiya, 

Shen, & Miao, 2011). 

The  Teachable  Agent  Arithmetic  Game  (TAAG)  has  been  developed  to  help  5th  grade 

students  learn  math  in  Sweden  (Pareto  et  al.,  2012).  The  competitive  nature  of  teachable 

agents  are  explored  as  well,  as  the  teachable  agent  was  implemented  in  a  game 

environment where students learn through collaboration or compete as a single player, or 

as  two  players,  either  with  another  student,  a  non-TA  computer  agent  or  other  teachable 

agents (SjÃ¶dÃ©n, TÃ¤rning, Pareto, & Gulz, 2011).  

Dynalearn is another project that consist a teachable agent that mimics a less capable 

learner that allows for learning-by-teaching pedagogy to be applied in an intelligent learning 

environment. The novelty of Dynalearn is in  the qualitative reasoning model generated by 

the learner which can be compared to other learners as well as experts, thus allowing the 

system the automation to provide appropriate feedback and recommendations (Bredeweg 

et al., 2010).   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  More recently, the Tangible Activities for Geometry (TAG) is a teachable agent that was 

developed  using  digital  augmented  devices  to  help  students  learn  geometry  by  solving 

problems  in  physical  space,  a  different  approach  from  other  teachable  agents  in  virtual 

environments (Muldner, Lozano, Girotto, Burleson, & Walker, 2013). In TAG, a robot named 

Quinn  is  constructed  using  the  LEGO  Mindstorm  robot  mounted  with  an  iPod  displaying 

facial  expression.  The  students  are  to  solve  geometry  problems  by  issuing  command  to 

Quinn where Quinn executes the command and check if the solution to the current problem 

is  correct.  Quinn  is  able  to  display  emotions  based  on  the  TAG  feedback  to  show  the 

students  how  it feels through  a  gender  neutral voice  message.    The  current  study on  TAG 

focuses  on  the  attributes  impact  of  the  interaction  between  Quinn  and  the  students 

(Muldner, Girotto, Lozano, Burleson, & Walker, 2014).    

The following Table 1 presents the comparison of the existing capabilities and features 

of  the  different  teachable  agent  systems.  The  majority  of  teachable  agents  are  able  to 

conduct conversation with student learners. All of the teachable agents embody a learning 

companion.  Artificial  intelligence  such  as  machine  learning,  decision  making  and  affective 

computing are used in systems such as the Bettyâs Brain, SimStudent, Virtual Singapura and 

TAG.  SimStudent  and  TAAG  are  teachable  agents  systems  that  are  used  in  mathematics 

learning  using  competition  and  cooperation  to  engage  student  learning.  The  teachable 

agent  in  Virtual  Singapura  is  the  only  teachable  agent  that  is  developed  in  a  3D  virtual 

environment.

2.1.3 Teachable Agents Related Issues 

Teachable  agents  are  based  on the  concept  that  students  learn  in  the process  of  teaching 

others,  the  pedagogical  concept  of  learning-by-teaching,  aid  learners  to  achieve  deeper 

learning when they take on the role of the tutor (Bargh & Schul, 1980; Gartner, 1971). The 

key to learning-by-teaching is that during the tutoring process student learners are able  to 

gain  a  more  complete  knowledge  by  refining  their  concepts  through  explaining  and 

reorganizing their own knowledge (Coleman, Brown, & Rivkin, 1997).   

During  the  tutoring  process,  learners  are  more  prepared  to  teach  their  peer  tutee  as 

compared to when they are learning for themselves (Annis, 1983). Tutors also benefit from 

explanation  and  questioning  interactions  with  tutees,  thus,  encouraging  student  tutors  to 

reflect  upon  the  problems  to  stimulate  deeper  reasoning  (Craig,  Sullins,  Witherspoon,  & 

Gholson,  2006).  Developments  in  research  on  learning-by-teaching  systems  are  based  on 

the  notion  in  education  and  cognitive  science  literature  that  learners  benefited  from 

tutoring as they learn as much as the tutee (Chi, Siler, Jeong, Yamauchi, & Hausmann, 2001). 

Besides  improving  understanding,  there  are  considerable  affective  and  cognitive  gains 

during the tutoring process (Lublin, 1990; McNall, 1975). Low performing students are also 

motivated  to  perform  better  with  teachable  agents  (SjÃ¶dÃ©n,  TÃ¤rning,  et  al.,  2011).  As 

preparation  to  teach  requires  tutors  to  organize  their  knowledge,  student  tutors  are 

observed to learn a great deal through assessment as well as reflection during the tutoring 

process (Biswas & Leeawong, 2005).  

Despite the advantages of the amount of knowledge gained during tutoring, there are 

several drawbacks with learning with teachable agents. Firstly, novice student tutors are not 

able to gauge their own understanding of the topic that they are teaching. This may cause 

them to commit errors or make mistakes when judge other sources of information (Azevedo 

&  Cromley,  2004).  Secondly,  learning-by-teaching  requires  the  student  learners  to  be  self-

monitored  and  self-regulated.  Student  learners  who  have  little  experience  or  low  prior 

knowledge  in  teaching  may  not  be  able  to  handle  tutee  enquiries  (Roscoe,  Wagster,  & 

Biswas,  2008).  Moreover,  student  tutors  also  does  not  fully  benefit  from  learning-by 

teaching  if  the  tutee  is  too  passive  and  does  not  provide  adequate  responses  from  the 

 
 
 
 
 
tutoring (Graesser & Person, 1994). In order for student tutors to fully benefit from tutoring 

the teachable agent, they have to be motivated to tutor the teachable agent (Uresti, 2000).  

There are also several challenges highlighted by Gulz et al. (2011), with regards to  the 

design  of  pedagogical  agents  in  intelligent  tutoring  systems  including  satisfying  âlearners 

expectation of agentâs knowledge and social profileâ, âdealing with learnerâs engagement in 

off-task  conversationâ  and  âmanaging  potential  abuse  of  the  agentâ  (Agneta  Gulz  et  al., 

2011),  especially  with  open-ended  learning  environment  as  in  Bettyâs  Brain  (Segedy, 

Kinnebrew, & Biswas, 2012) and conversational SimStudent (Carlson et al., 2012).  Therefore, 

there are suggestions to design specific âoff-taskâ interaction that in particular help to build 

rapport and trust, provide breaks in between learning to improve engagement (A. Gulz et al., 

2010). 

The  importance  of  understanding  learnerâs  ability  in  order  to  provide  appropriate 

feedback  is  also  echoed  in  earlier  studies  on  SimStudent,  which  showed  that  âprior 

knowledge  has  a  strong  influence  on  the  tutor  learningâ(Matsuda,  Keiser,  Raizada, 

Stylianides, et al., 2010). Segedy (2011) suggests the use of a combination of âmetricsâ, such 

as  âresponsivenessâ  and  âperformanceâ  as  a  benchmark  to  determine  whether  learners 

need more support or feedback  (J. R. Segedy, John S. Kinnebrew, & Gautam Biswas, 2011) 

with  the  use  of    cognitive  and  meta-cognitive  model  derived  from  Hidden  Markov  model 

from  learnerâs  behaviour  to  understand  student  learning  strategies,  thus  applying  suitable 

level scaffolding and feedback.  

The  Teachable  Agent  Arithmetic  Game  (TAAG)  was  used  to  evaluate  the  studentâs 

performance,  attitude  and  self-efficiency.  The  results  showed  positive  improvements  in 

conceptual arithmetic understanding and self-efficiency however does not support positive 

attitudes towards math (Pareto, Arvemo, Dahl, Haake, & Gulz, 2011).  

  More recent developments indicate the interest in understanding the benefits of social 

interaction of learners through tutoring and interacting with teachable agents  (Ogan et al., 

2012),  as  well  as  the  motivation  factors  for  learning-by-teaching  in  teachable  agents 

(Matsuda et al., 2012). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
The development of teachable agents demonstrates the benefits for applying learning-

by-teaching  pedagogy  in  intelligent  tutoring  systems.  The  significant  portion  of  work  on 

teachable agents are dedicated towards simulating peer-liked interactions between learners 

and  teachable  agent,  providing  support  and  feedback  in  open-ended  teachable  agent 

learning environment as well as encouraging competition and collaboration among student 

learners  and  teachable  agents.  There  is  also  a  need  to  look  into  ways  to  alter  studentâs 

attitudes towards the subject domain, and expand the application of teachable agents.  

Table 2 shows the comparison between the different teachable agent systems in terms 

of their innovations and application domains. The majority of teachable agents are applied 

in  mathematics  and  science  learning,  other  applications  also  include  economics  in  the 

DENISE and environmental science in the DynaLearn teachable agent system. As can be seen 

from the literature review on teachable agents, none of the systems have been applied to 

intergenerational learning.

2.2  From Persuasion Theories to Persuasive Technologies  

Persuasion is a fundamental interaction between human beings, in the attempt to influence 

others by modifying attitudes, beliefs, intentions, motivations or behaviours (Gass & Seither, 

2010)  and  widely  applied  in  areas  such  as  rhetoric,  social  psychology,  communications, 

advertising  and  public  relations.  Simon  (2001),  defined  persuasion  as  the  âhuman 

communication designed to influence the autonomous judgment of othersâ (Simons, 2001).   

In  section  2.2  of the  literature  review,  two  closely  related theories  of  persuasion  that 

contribute to the development of the PTA, namely, the Heuristics-Systems of Model and the 

Elaboration  Likelihood  Model  (ELM)  of  persuasion  will  be  introduced.  Following  that,  the 

literature  review  examines  the  development  of  persuasive  technology,  looking  at  the 

various persuasive frameworks and models that have emerge from persuasion theories and 

how  they  have  been  used  to  address  issues  in  user  interactions  in  systems  design.  At  the 

end of this section of the literature review, various applications of persuasive technologies 

in healthcare and education will also be reviewed. 

2.2.1 Heuristic-Systematic Model 

Heuristic and systematic views of persuasion regard that the person receiving the message 

is concerned with assessing the validity of the messageâs overall conclusion (Shelly  Chaiken, 

1980).  

The  Heuristic-Systematic  model  (HSM)  involves  heuristic  processing  and  systematic 

processing.  During  heuristics  processing,  the  message  recipient  uses  little  effort  in 

processing and assessing the validity of the message. Instead, judgments are formed based 

on  existing  learned  memory.  Heuristic  processing  is  useful  in  presenting  messages  that 

require  little  cognitive  effort  on  the  message  receiver.  On  the  other  hand,  systematic 

 
 
 
 
 
processing  requires  much  more  cognitive  effort  in  performing  the  task  and  requires  the 

recipients  understand  and  evaluate  the  arguments  in  the  persuasive  message  in  order  to 

accept the messageâs conclusion (Chen, Duckworth, & Chaiken, 1999).  

The experiment conducted by Chaiken in 1980 on source and message concluded that 

the content of the message out-weight the likeability of the source. In terms of persistence 

change,  content  mediated  opinion  change  lasted  longer  than  source-mediated  persuasion 

(Shelly    Chaiken,  1980).  HSM  is  a  dual  process  model  that  explains  the  way  persuasive 

messages are perceived. 

2.2.2 Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion 

The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) of persuasion is another example of dualistic model 

developed  by  Petty,  Cacioppo  and  colleagues  (1986).  Both  ELM  and  HSM  offer  broad 

similarity  in  the  notion  that  persuasion  varying  in  the  degree  of  issue  related  thought 

processes. ELM differs from other models as there is added attention towards retention of 

change  in  attitudes  through  the  use  of  peripheral  and  the  central  persuasion  routes.  The 

central route of persuasion requires the recipient to take on in-depth consideration of the 

information presented, while the peripheral route requires little or negligible scrutiny (Petty 

& Cacioppo, 1986). 

According  to  the  ELM,  attitudes  formed  under  the  central  route  are  more  persistent 

compared to the attitudes formed under the peripheral route, and behaviours are predictive 

and  resistant  to  change until  clear  counter  information  is presented  to alter  the  merits  of 

the  object.  The  ELM  outlines  a  general  theory  of  attitude  change  and  the  underlying 

framework for persuasive communications. The following Fig 1 is a diagram that shows the 

central  and  peripheral  routes  of  persuasion  in  which  attitude  change  can  be  achieved, 

according to the ELM theory of persuasion. 

 
 
 
 
Figure 1 Central and Peripheral routes to Persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)  

Elaboration  

The ELM recognizes that the characteristic of the recipient of a message varies in the degree 

of  engagement  in  topic-related  thinking  in  different  situations.  The  term  âelaborationâ  in 

ELM  refers  to  the  process  of  the  degree  of  âissue  â  relevant  thinkingâ  required  by  the 

recipient of the persuasive message.  

According  to  ELM,  as  the  likelihood  of  elaboration  increases,  the  quality  of  issue-

relevant  arguments  becomes  the  determinant  of  persuasion.  On  the  other  hand,  as  the 

likelihood of elaboration decreases peripheral cues become more important. 

 
 
 
 
 
Various  factors  have  been  identified to  influence  degree  of elaboration.  These  factors 

that  influence  elaboration  falls  into  two  categories,  one  involves  the  motivation  of  the 

receiver  and  the  other  is  the  ability  of  the  receiver  to  engage  in  elaboration.  When  the 

recipient is high in motivation and ability, able to process the content of the message,  the 

central  route  is  likely  prevail,  while  peripheral  route  occurs  when  motivation  and ability is 

low (Schwarz, Bless, & Bohner, 1991). Elaboration occurs when both ability and motivation 

is present (O'Keefe, 2002).  

The  following  are  variables  that  are  can  increase  or  decrease  message  elaboration 

under  the  central  processing  route,  based  on  the  amount  of  ability  and  motivation  of  the 

message recipient (Petty, Cacioppo, Sedikides, & Strathman, 1988).  

Factors affecting Elaboration Motivation 

PERSONAL RELEVANCE     As messages become more personally relevant to the receiver, the 

receiver  becomes  more  likely  to  engage  in  issue  relevant  thought.  When  personal 

involvement is high, individuals tend to process message content rationally. When personal 

involvement  is  low,  the content of  the  message becomes  less  important,  thus  seeking  the 

peripheral route rather than central route in message processing  (Petty & Cacioppo, 1981, 

1984; Petty, Cacioppo, & Schumann, 1983; Petty et al., 1988).  

In ELM, research reports are labelled according to a receiversâ level of âinvolvementâ in 

topic  related  issues.  In  persuasion  research,  âinvolvementâ  covers  a  wide  variety  of 

relationship  that  the  message  recipient  has  with  the  topic,  including  judgment  of 

importance and commitment to the issue. According to ELM, involvement is specific to the 

induction of personal relevance of the topic (O'Keefe, 2002).  

Johnson  and  Eagly  (1989),  defined  âinvolvement  as  motivational  state  induced  by  an 

association  between  an  activated  attitude  and  self-conceptâ,  this  implies  that  the  level  of 

involvement  affects  the  change  in  attitude.  The  message  recipient  is  dependent  on  his  or 

her  self-concept  that  generates  the  sense  of  involvement.  Johnson  and  Eagly  (1989) 

distinguished  three  aspects  of  involvement,  established  by  self-concept.  Value-relevant 

involvement  is  activated  by  oneâs  enduring  value,  outcome-relevant  involvement  depends 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on  oneâs  ability  to  obtain  desirable  outcome  while  establishing  impression-relevant 

involvement depends on the impression one makes on others. 

In  their  study  involving  value-relevant  involvements  and  impression-relevant,  subjects 

with  high  involvement  are  less  persuaded  compared  to  those  low  in  involvement.  With 

outcome-relevant  involvement,  subjects  who  are  high-involvement  are  more  persuaded 

than low involvement individuals (Johnson & Eagly, 1989).  

Persuasion  researches  on  involvement  conditions  have  shown  that  under  high 

involvement, the quality of arguments have greater impact compared to low involvement. 

Under  conditions  with  low  involvement,  peripheral  cues  such  as  source  expertise,  and 

attractiveness  of  message  source  prevails,  (Petty  &  Cacioppo,  1984;  Petty,  Cacioppo,  & 

Goldman, 1981). Individuals put in much more cognitive effort to elaborate on issues when 

they  are  highly  involved  to  take  on  a  central  route  in  information  processing.  Whereas 

under conditions of low involvement, they are more affected by simple heuristic cues such 

as  acceptance  and  rejections  based  on  source  and  message  characteristics,  choosing  the 

peripheral  route  in  processing  information  (S.  Chaiken  &  Maheswaran,  1994;  Petty  et  al., 

1983). 

PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY 

Personal  responsibility  of  an  individual  determines  the 

amount of effort one is willing to put in evaluating the persuasive message. Petty, Harkins, 

and  Williams  (1980),  showed  that  the  quality  of  argument  becomes  less  important  with 

decreasing  personal  responsibility.  With  shared  responsibility  among  group  evaluators, 

weak  messages  are  more  favourable,  whereas  individual  evaluators  preferred  strong 

messages.  A  mixed  message  containing  both  strong  and  weak  arguments  does  not  have 

effect on either shared or group evaluation (Petty, Harkins, & Williams, 1980).  

NEED FOR COGNITION 

The  receiverâs  need 

for  cognition  can 

influence  the 

motivation  for  elaboration  and  indicate  oneâs  inclination  towards  engaging  in  cognitive 

activities.  As  Cacioppo  and  Petty  (1982)  describes,  some  people  enjoy  thought  engaging 

activities while others do not (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982).  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Findings by Cacioppo et al. (1983), shows that individuals with high need for cognition 

are  more  likely  to  discriminate  between  strong  and  weak  arguments  when  evaluating  the 

merits of supportive arguments. They are also more likely to be influenced by the quality of 

the  message  presented  when  forming  impressions  of  the  communicator,  recall  more 

message  arguments  regardless  of  cogency,  and  they  account  more  cognitive  effort 

compared to those with low need for cognition, (Cacioppo, Petty, Kao, & Rodriguez, 1986; 

Cacioppo, Petty, & Morris, 1983).  

Factors affecting Elaboration Ability 

MESSAGE REPETITION 

  Message repetition is a characteristic that has been shown to 

influence  the  ability  for  recipients  to  elaborate  on  arguments.  Cacioppo  and  Petty,  (1989) 

have shown that repeated messages allow for more exposure and thus the recipients have 

more  time  to  elaborate  on  messages.  Compared  to  one  exposure,  three  exposures  to 

messages  increased  effectiveness  of  persuasion  based  on  strong  arguments  but  showed  a 

counter effect on weak arguments (Cacioppo & Petty, 1989).       

DISTRACTION 

Interruptions  distract  and  have  been  shown  to  intervene  with 

systematic  message  processing.  The  quality  of  argument  becomes  less  important  as  there 

are  fewer  chances  for  issue  relevant  thinking.  When  the  message  recipient  is  highly 

motivated  and  has  the  ability  to  process  the  message,  distraction  becomes  a  bothersome 

disrupter  to  the  ability  to  process  information  (Petty  &  Cacioppo,  1986).    Recipients  with 

good  mood  are  less  affected  by  distraction,  suggesting  they  did  not  engage  in  message 

elaboration,  compared  to  those  who  are  in  bad  mood  (Bless,  Bohner,  Schwarz,  &  Strack, 

1990). 

PRIOR KNOWLEDGE 

An  individual  ability  to  elaborate  on  a  message  is  influenced  by 

their prior knowledge on the topic  suggesting that recipients hold salient self-schema that 

led them to act subjectively when evaluating persuasive messages. This in turn causes them 

to  engage  in  increased  issue  relevant  thinking  to  counter  strong  conflicting  arguments  to 

their beliefs (Cacioppo, Petty, & Sidera, 1982).  Wood (1982), suggested similar notion that 

subjects  who  have  less  prior  knowledge  are  more  susceptible  to  persuasion  as  it  reduces 

chances of counter-argument on the message (Wood, 1982).   

 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3  Persuasive Technology  

Technology  that  is  designed  to  influence  attitude  and  behaviour  change  are  known  as 

Persuasive Technology. Torning and Oinas-Kukkonen (2009) identified 4 areas of research in 

computer-based  fields  where  persuasive  systems  and  design  can  be  observed,  namely, 

human-computer interaction, computer-mediated communication, information systems and 

affective computing (Torning & Oinas-Kukkonen, 2009).  

2.3.1 Persuasive Frameworks and Models 

Information  systems  and  computerized  software  that  are  designed  to  strengthen, 

modify  attitudes  and  behaviours  or  both  without  coercion  or  deception  are  known  as 

persuasive systems (H. Oinas-Kukkonen & M. Harjumaa, 2008).  

The  Persuasive  System  Design  (PSD)  model  is  a  framework  created  to  provide  a 

guideline for persuasive design and software requirements  (Harri Oinas-Kukkonen & Marja 

Harjumaa,  2008).  The  PSD  model  is  made  up  of  a  persuasion  context  following  a  three 

phrase process, which consists of the intent, event and strategy.  

According to the PSD model (Oinas-Kukkonen & Harjumaa, 2009), the intent comprises 

of the persuader and the change type. There are three types of persuader, the endogenous 

type,  who  is  the  creator  of  the  technology,  and  the  exogenous,  those  who  distribute  the 

technology,  and  lastly  the  autogenous  type,  who  are  the  users  of  the  technology.  The 

change type of the  intent defines the desired  behaviour change. The event phrase defines 

the  use  context,  user  context  and  technology  context.  The  use  and  user  context  help  the 

system  designer  to understand  the  specific  user  issues  and needs,  while  the  technological 

context helps to evaluate the strength and weakness of the technology used of the system 

(Wiafe, Alhammad, Nakata, & Gulliver, 2012).  

Lastly,  the  strategy  phrase  consists  of  the  message  and  the  route.  The  message 

considers the form to transform the intended change in behaviour. While the route refers to 

the  selection of  indirect  or  direct route or both approach  to persuasion  (Torning  &  Oinas-

Kukkonen, 2009).  In addition the PSD model examines the non-functional design principles 

 
 
 
in  persuasive  system  design  such  as  primary  task  support,  dialogue  support,  system 

credibility support and social support. 

Another key dimension to human computer persuasion is related to how users interpret 

persuasive  messages  from  computers.  This  can  be  traced  to  social  psychology  research  in 

persuasion. Social psychologist, Fishbein and Ajzen proposed the Theory of Reasoned Action 

(TRA)  suggesting  that  the  actions  that  a  person  intended  to  take  in  a  situation  can  be 

predicted by their attitude and subjective norm towards the intended behaviour (Fishbein & 

Ajzen,  1975).  TRA  has  been  applied  to  the  Technology  Acceptance  Model  (TAM)  in 

information  system  design,  to  anticipate  userâs  acceptance  to  technology.  Elaboration 

Likelihood Model (ELM) proposed by Petty, Cacioppo and colleagues, is a social psychology 

theory  that  explains  how  individuals  perceive  persuasive  messages.  The  ELM  is  a  dualistic 

model, proposing that attitude change takes on either a peripheral route or a central route 

of thought process. Under the peripheral route in the ELM, there is little thinking to process 

the  information  presented  whereas  the  central  route  there  is  in-depth  consideration 

involved (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986).  

Together with the Persuasive System Design (PSD) framework used for developing and 

evaluating  persuasive  systems  (Torning  &  Oinas-Kukkonen,  2009)  and  ELM  model,  the  3-

Dimensional  Relationship  between  Attitude  and  Behaviour  (3-RAB)  model  is  developed  to 

analyse  the  change  type,  user  and  use  context  and  route  of  persuasion  to  attitude  and 

behavioural change (Wiafe et al., 2012).  

The  majority  of  research  in  persuasive  technologies  and  persuasion  in  systems  design 

are  towards  the  applications  of  persuasive  frameworks  and  the  analysis  and  design 

persuasion in systems.  

2.3.2 The Application of Persuasive Technology in Health Care and 

Education 

The applications of persuasive technology can be seen far and wide. Persuasive technology 

has been applied include advertising, management, governance and public health. In view of 

the scope of this thesis, we have chosen to examine the areas of health and learning.  

 
 
 
Applications in Health Care 

In the area of health care, persuasive technologies are often used to encourage healthy 

lifestyle  changes  such  as  changing  oneâs  behaviour  in  making  healthier  food  choices,  and 

exercising more regularly (Pinzon & Iyengar, 2012).  One such application involves âjust-in-

timeâ  feedback  to  encourage  healthier  choices.  This  is  synonymous  with  the  concept  of 

Kairos in persuasion, where information is provided at the right moment to influence oneâs 

decision.  One  example  of  the  use  of  persuasive  technology  is  the  use  of  sensors  in  our 

environment  to  provide  context-aware  information.  Smart  devices  are  used  to  provide 

relevant  information  to  make  health  related  information.  The  MIT  PlaceLab  is  a  research 

facility that studies the possibilities of technologies to improve the wellbeing of residents in 

a smart home environment, where sensors and context-aware software are used to provide 

persuasive  information  to  influence  behaviours    in  a  real  life  scenario  (Logan  &  Healey, 

2006).   

Another example area in which persuasive technology can be used in health care is the 

smart pill box which reminds the elderly to take their medications. Such devices can be used 

to understand the reason why the elderly forget to take their medication. By analysing the 

behavioural and situational context information, appropriate persuasive information can be 

provided to remind them to take their medications (Lundell et al., 2006).  

Wearable  computing  is  another  area  in  which  persuasive  technology  can  be  applied. 

Such devices help users monitor their lifestyle and motivate them to adopt healthy lifestyle 

changes.  Commercial  devices  include  health  monitors,  pedometers  and  activity  trackers. 

These  wearable  devices  help  users  can  keep  a  log  on  their  food  intake,  to  track  their  diet 

and  workout  routines  (Ananthanarayan  &  Siek,  2012).    These  devices  allow  users  to  track 

and share their activity logs and share them with friends on social media to motivate them 

in changing their behaviours through healthy competition.  

Applications in Education and Learning  

The  education  field  is  an  area  that  is  fast  changing.  This  requires  educators  to  adapt  to  a 

generation  of  young  learners  who  are  comfortable  with  learning  with  technology.  Digital 

narrative software with persuasion infused has been developed to motivate children to read 

 
 
 
and write, using persuasion principles such as similarity, tailoring and credibility to motivate 

literary learning (Lucero, Zuloaga, Mota, & MuÃ±oz, 2006).  

Persuasive strategies are also adapted in persuasive dialogue systems such as embodied 

conversational  agents  (ECA)  designed  for  learning.  An  example  of  an  ECA  that  provides 

supportive and expressive dialogue is the learning companion in the âHow Was Your Day?â 

application,  where  the ECA  provides  affective persuasion  that  aims to influence  the userâs 

attitude positively (Cavazza et al., 2010).  

Efforts  such  as  the  EuroPLOT  project  (persuasive  learning  objects  and  technologies) 

(Gram-Hansen, SchÃ¤rfe, & Dinesen, 2012; Herber, 2011) aim to adapt persuasive design as a 

component  in  the  pedagogical  framework.  Persuasive  design  is  also  considered  in  the 

development  of  the  content  design  tools  and  design  patterns  in  the  EuroPLOT  project  to 

encourage active learning engagement.   

The  application of persuasive technology in educational setting can be demonstrated in 

the  HANDS  (Helping  Autism-diagnosed  teenagers  Navigating  and  Developing  Socially) 

project  (Mintz  &  Aagaard,  2012).  The  HANDS  project  aims  to  assist  autistic  children  to 

develop social skills using smartphone application with persuasive design. Drawing upon the 

concept of Kairos, namely delivering the right message at the correct timing and place, the 

mobile  software  application  is  user-centred  design  approach  expressing  the  needs  of 

teachers,  children  and  parents.  The  user-centred  design  approach  considers  the  userâs 

limitations,  needs  and  wants  at  every  stage  of  the  software  development  process  (Abras, 

Maloney-Krichmar,  &  Preece,  2004).  Teachers  are  able  to  develop  intervention  sequences 

using a flexible web-based toolkit to support each individual child in their learning.  

The  application  of  persuasive  technology  in  educational  and  learning  setting  shows 

potential. With the integration of persuasive design principles drawn from multi-disciplinary 

research, there are possibilities to extend its applications.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4  Intergenerational Learning 

According  to  the  Encyclopaedia  of  the  Sciences  of  Learning,  intergenerational  learning  is 

defined as âthe learning that happens naturally in the home between parents and children 

and includes the wider family and community,â ("Intergenerational Learning," 2012).  

The concept of intergenerational learning stems from the idea exchange of knowledge 

from the older generation to the young and vice versa. With the growing aging population, 

the  idea  of  âproductive  agingâ  where  the  elderly  leading  meaningful  and  active  life  were 

promoted at the end of the 20th century (Brabazon & Disch, 1997; M. Kaplan, Kusano, Tsuji, 

&  Hisamichi,  1998;  Newman  et  al.,  1997),  where  the  elderly  are  highlighted  as  valuable 

resources  instead  of  seen  as  a  burden  to  the  society  for  the  growing  cost  of  health  care 

system and public pension (Gonyea, 1999). 

2.5   

Intergenerational Learning Programmes (ILP) 

In 1997, Newman proposed  the use of intergenerational programmes as an embodiment of 

intergenerational  concept  that  âinvolved  planned  ongoing  interactions  between  non-

biologically linked children, youth and older adultsâ (Newman et al., 1997).  Kaplan (1998), 

however,  defined  intergeneration  initiatives  as  âactivities,  events  and  ongoing  programs 

designed  to  increase  cooperation,  interaction  or  exchange  between  people  between  sixty 

years of age and older and twenty years of age and younger (M. Kaplan et al., 1998).â  

Recognizing the changes in society that are occurring worldwide, the UNESCO Institute 

of Education published a monograph, highlighting a series of initiatives in various countries 

in  intergenerational  work  that  drives  social  and  policy  changes.  The  intergenerational 

learning  programmes  highlighted  and  identified  various  areas  of  impact  in  public  policies 

and recommendations for development and implementation strategies.  

Countries  such  as  Germany,  Japan,  the  Netherlands,  the  USA,  and  the  UK  have 

developed  the  following  three  most  frequently  described  models  of  intergenerational 

programmes.  These  frequently  described  models  are,  firstly,  involving  older  adults  serving 

children. Secondly, children and youths serving older adults or the old, and lastly, the young 

serving the communities (BostrÃ¶m et al., 1999).  

 
 
 
 
 
 
In  1999,  the  UNESCO  Institute  of  Education  (UIE)  held  a  meeting  in  Dortmund  among 

countries where researchers from China, Cuba, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Palestine, 

South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States came upon a definition for 

the  concept  of 

intergenerational  programmes 

(BostrÃ¶m,  2003),  âIntergenerational 

programmes  are  vehicles  for  purposeful  and  ongoing  exchange  of  resources  and  learning 

among older and younger generationsâ (BostrÃ¶m, Hatton-Yeo, & Ohsako, 2000). 

Intergenerational  learning  programmes  are  channels  in  which  purposeful  exchange  of 

resources and learning among the older and younger generations can be achieved (BostrÃ¶m 

et  al.,  2000).  The  goal  of  ILP  is  to  create  opportunities,  where  interactions  between  the 

young and old promotes social growth and learning in informal settings (Newman & Hatton-

Yeo,  2008).  Informal  learning  occurs  when people  learn  from  one  another,  which  includes 

values, attitudes knowledge and skills (Tuijnman & BostrÃ¶m, 2002).  

M.S. Kaplan (2002) describes intergenerational programmes as those used in schools to 

which  benefit  student  learning  and  the  communities  involved,  particularly  the  elderly 

participants,  where  young  people  are  given  the  opportunity  to  âinteract,  support,  and 

provide care for one anotherâ (M. S. Kaplan, 2002) 

BostrÃ¶m  (2003)  also  additionally  observes  the  potentially  beneficial  social  interaction 

between teachers, grandparents and the child which resulted from the increase amount of 

time the child spends in new social structures outside of the family such as day-care centre 

and schools (BostrÃ¶m, 2003). 

Cross generational relationships are rewarding. However, due to the changes in modern 

lifestyles there is less time for bonding. This could be due to work or school commitments 

resulting  in  less  time  for  the  child  to  interact  with  their  parents,  or  children  moving  away 

from their parents. As a result, the older generation has a lesser chance to spend time with 

their children or grandchildren.  

Table 3 shows a series of programmes initiated by the European Commission aimed at 

examining the challenges of aging and looking at areas in which the elderly contribute to the 

 
 
 
 
society  ("ICT  For  Seniorsâ  And  Intergenerational  Learning  -  Projects  funded  through  the 

Lifelong Learning Programme from 2008 to 2011," 2012).

2.5.1 Intergenerational Learning Programmes in Singapore 

According to the Committee on Aging Report on Ageing Population in 2006,  there are 

existing  programmes  organized  by  the  community.  This  report  recommend  that  more  can 

be  done  to  provide  learning  as  well  as  greater  intergenerational  bonding  initiatives 

opportunities  to  the  seniors  ("Committee  on  Ageing  Issues  Report  on  the  Ageing 

Population," 2006).   

  More recently, Singapore seeks to provide more opportunities for the seniors to engage 

in  lifelong  learning  so  that  they  stay  relevant  and  keep  their  mental  awareness.  One 

initiative is the Intergenerational Learning Programme (ILP) by the Council for the Third Age 

(C3A)  setup  in  2011,  which  provides  an  opportunity  for  the  elderly  to  engage  in  lifelong 

learning  where  youths  are  matched  with  senior  âteachersâ  in  a  classroom-based  learning 

programme  to  encourage  intergeneration  bonds  ("Intergenerational  Learning  Programme 

(ILP)," 2011). Family Services Central (www.family-central.sg) is a service appointed by the 

Council for the Third Age (C3A) as the main organizer in conducting these ILPs in Singapore. 

Photography, wellness, web design IT, floral arrangement and photo editing courses such as 

âBasic Photoshop for Photographersâ are organized regularly for seniors above 50 years of 

age.  These  courses  are  initiated  by  school  clubs,  student  groups  as  service  learning 

initiatives.  The  aim  is  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  youths  to  learn  important  life  lessons 

and values through interaction with the elderly, while the seniors gain skills and knowledge 

from their younger counterparts ("Intergenerational Learning Programme ", 2011).  

2.5.2 Intergenerational Games â Research   

Intergenerational  learning  can  be  achieved  through  playas  as  the  younger  and  older 

generations can benefit from the exchanges which take place during intergenerational play 

(Davis,  Larkin,  &  Graves,  2002).  Research  has  been  done  in  the  area  of  interactive  games 

which  aim  at  keeping  families  members  engaged  through  intergenerational  play.  Various 

intergenerational games have been developed to facilitate this research. Table 4 shows the 

list of intergenerational games that are reviewed.

and their grandchildren. The concept of the game is based on the Curling and Bowling game. 

The  players  in  the  Curball  game  are  required  to  âthrowâ  a  tangible  ball  embedded  with 

sensors  in  order  to  manoeuvre  a  virtual  ball  through  augmented  reality  to  the  end  of  the 

board.  The  Curball  game  encourages  communication  between  the  older  person  and  the 

other player e.g. the grandchild (Kern, Stringer, Fitzpatrick, & Schmidt, 2006).  

Age  invader  (AI)  is  a  multi-player  game  where  players  interact  in  physical  space  or 

participate  in  the  game  over  the  internet.    This  is  a  physical  game,  with  additional  games 

that  requires  puzzle  solving.  AI  is  a  game  that  stimulates  cognitive,  physical  health, 

encourage collaboration and bonding among the seniors and young (Khoo, Cheok, Nguyen, 

& Pan, 2008). 

Family Quest is study based on a multiplayer 3D game. The game reveals the dynamics 

of intergenerational play between Players ages 9-13 and their parents (Siyahhan, Barab, & 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Downton, 2010). Family Quest is analysed using Active Theory. The components of activity 

are broken down into items such as tools, goals, norms and rules are constantly evolving in 

relation as a result of the activity system (Cole, 1996; Greenberg, 2001).   

Xtreme Gardener is a game which requires the cooperation between a pair of players to 

nurture a set of virtual garden plates using silhouette interaction as modes of control, the 

study highlights the challenge of designing intergenerational bonding games (Rice, Yau, Ong, 

Wan, & Ng, 2012).  

2.6  Case Studies  

In  this  section, two  case  studies  on  educational gaming platforms  that the  researcher  was 

involved in which have the potential to be developed for intergenerational learning will be 

reviewed.  

The first  case  study  is  the  Family Pet  is  an  educational  game  which  allow  for  users  to 

engage  in  communication  with  family  members.  The  second  case  study  is  the  Virtual 

Singapura (VS) learning environment, which is developed as an educational game platform 

for science learning.   

2.6.1 Case Study: Family Pet 

Family Pet  is  an  educational  game  designed for the  Apple  iOS,  with the goal  of  promoting 

family  bonding  (Anthony,  2013).    In  the  Family  Pet,  there  is  a  virtual  family  pet  that 

simulates real-life pet. Family members take on the responsibility to ensure  the well-being 

of  a  virtual  pet.  In  the  process,  they  can  participate  in  educational  and  casual  activities 

together and thus foster strong bonds.  

During the Family Pet gameplay, the young players take on the main role of taking care 

of the family pet and decisions are made on the way the virtual pet is raised such as the type 

of food the virtual pet consumes and the activities that the pet engage in.  

The  older  family  members  are  informed  of  the  choices  made  by  the  younger  players 

had  made  through  the  pet.  The  Family  Pet  game  platform  then  prompts  discussions 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between the generations to create an opportunity for the family to communicate with each 

other. 

Figure 2 Family Pet Login Screen Shot 

Fig. 2 shows the login screen of Family Pet where user can choose to login using an 

existing account or register as a new user. The registered user can view the status of the pet 

including the name, age and stage of as well as the daily activities of the pet. Besides naming 

the pet, the platform allows the user to personalize the background of the application and 

to adjust the font sizes of the text in Family Pet as shown in Fig. 3   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3 Personalization of Platform 

The notifications screen in Fig 4 shows the current status of the pet that the pet owner 

needs to address. For example, upon the notification as shown in the screenshot, the user is 

required to participate in studying activity with the virtual pet. Upon choosing the activity to 

participate,  the  user  can  select  from  the  various  subjects  such  as  mathematics,  science, 

social for discussions which the user can participate together with the pet.

In addition to studying with their pet, users can feed or choose to play with their pet as 

shown in Fig. 4.  

Figure 5 Feeding and Playing with Family Pet 

  With  care  and  attention  given  to  the  pet,  it  will  evolve  in  terms  of  growth.  The 

application will also unlock new study topics and games whereas if the state of the pet is not 

well taken care of the pet it will cause the state of pet to retrogress.   Fig.5 shows some of 

the games in Family Pet, such as the tick-tack-toe, connect two and sliding game.

2.6.2  

 Persuasive Features in Family Pet 

The Family Pet has adopted several persuasive strategies in the effort to motivate users of 

the  application.  One  of  the  prominent  persuasive  features  in  Family  Pet  for  example  is 

operant  conditioning.  Coined  by  B.F  Skinner,  operant  conditioning  involves  reinforcement 

and punishment as the consequences of behaviour (Skinner, 1938). In the case of family pet, 

when the user performs a correct behaviour, such as when they have taken good care of the 

pet in Family Pet, they will be rewarded with additional games and study topics  as well as 

 
 
 
 
 
 
the growth in their pet. If the user does not take care of their pet properly, the state of the 

growth of the pet will be affected negatively.  

Another persuasive feature is the role of the virtual pet as a persuasive social actor in 

which the pet plays a social role of a family pet in the application. A social actor can bring 

about  social  responses  from  the  users  by  providing  social  support  (Fogg,  2002;  Reeves  & 

Nass,  1996).  The  social  actor  in  Family  Pet  aims  to  persuade  its  users  by  creating  a 

relationship  with  the  pet,  thus  bridging  the  communication  between  the  child  user  who 

takes care of the pet and adult users who monitors the application.  

Social cues such as physical attractiveness of the pet, designed to appeal to young users 

were  also  considered  and  incorporated.  Other  social  cues  in  the  form  of  psychological 

expression  of  empathy  and  personality  through  the  language  of  the  pet  also  attributes  to 

the  building  of  relationships  with  the  user.  There  are  also  social  dynamics  such  as  turn 

taking in the games that the user plays with the virtual pet and positive responses from the 

pet  when  the  user  has  completed  the  designated  task.  As  well  as  social  role  in  which  the 

user plays the role of a friend towards the family pet and reciprocity in game play.  

2.6.3 Case Study: Virtual Singapura 

Virtual Singapura (VS) is a 3D virtual learning environment (VLE) developed to help learners 

from lower secondary level understand concepts of science topics and gain inquiry skills by 

completing  learning  tasks  through  interaction  with  teachable  agents  in  the  VLE.  The 

teachable  agent  in  VS  requires  students  to  teach  the  teachable  agent  by  completing  a 

concept  map  to  simulate  the  learning-by-teaching  process.  The  students  are  evaluated 

based on how well their teachable agents are taught. 

 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7 Screenshot of the mini game in VS project. 

During  the  field  study  conducted  in  multiple  lower  secondary  schools  in  Singapore,  it 

was  observed  that  studentâs  learning  experiences  had  been  satisfactory  (Yu  et  al.,  2009). 

The  students  enjoyed  the  ability  to  fly,  float  and  walk  on  water,  actions  which  were  only 

possible  in  the  immersive  virtual  environment.  Students  also  enjoyed  participating  in  mini 

games shown such as the âshooting gameâ, where they were required to generate âfoodâ 

with other team players collaboratively by combining carbon dioxide molecules with water 

molecules as shown in Fig. 7. Based on the qualitative data collection during the field study 

however,  it  was  observed  that  most  of  the  activities  that  the  students  enjoyed  were  not 

related to learning with the teachable agent. 

This  case  study  has  prompted  us  to  improve  the  existing  teachable  agent  so  that 

students will find interacting with teachable agents more enjoyable.  

2.7  Discussion 

Based on the case studies reviewed, to our best knowledge, there is a current research gap 

in applying persuasion to teachable agents. So far, none of the teachable agents reviewed 

have the ability to apply persuasion for the users to learn by teaching.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Although  learning-by-teaching  have  been  proven  to  benefit  the  young  (Chase  et  al., 

2009; SjÃ¶dÃ©n, Silvervarg, et al., 2011). There is currently no research applying the theory in 

the  context  of  intergeneration  learning,  since  the  majority  of  intergeneration  games 

research is focused on engaging players from different generations through game play.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
3   Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA) 

Intergenerational learning involves people from all ages to working together in meaningful 

learning activities where they are able to learn from each another to allow for continuous 

transfer  of  knowledge.  To  accomplish  this  aim,  the  PTA  behaviour  has  to  be  convincing 

enough so that learners will be  motivate to teaching the PTA. By engaging in teaching the 

PTA, learners from different generations can come together and share their knowledge and 

benefit from the learning-by-teaching process.  

In  this  section,  the  definition  of  the  PTA  is  defined.  The  PTA  architecture  will  be 

introduced. The persuasion reasoning will be presented to explain the relationship between 

the  persuasion  theory,  agent  and  computation model  that  allows the  PTA to  generate the 

persuasive actions that the agent carries out to influence learners to teach the PTA.  

3.1  PTA Architecture 

The  PTA  consists  of  the  teachable  agent  learning  environment  where  the  learner  teaches 

the agent by constructing a concept map using the learning-by-teaching pedagogy. Fig. 8 is 

the diagram of the PTA architecture.  

Figure 8 Diagram of persuasive teachable agent architecture 

The PTA architecture in Fig. 8 can be expressed as a tuple in the form of: 

PTA = (E, P, K, Tr, Pr) 

-  E, Environment  

 
 
 
 
ï·  The environment in which the agent interacts with 

-  P, Events Tracker 

ï·  Precepts that the agent senses in the environment 

-  K, Knowledge Base 

ï·  Stores the knowledge the agent has learnt from the learner 

-  Tr, Teachability Reasoning 

ï·  Reasons and reflects on the knowledge taught 

-  Pr, Persuasive Reasoning 

ï·  The reasoning model for the agent to derive persuasion 

The events tracker receives the user learning activity data and the knowledge that the 

learners have taught the teachable agent from the environment. The knowledge base stores 

the  PTAâs  knowledge  that  the  agent  learnt  from  the  student  tutor,  while  the  teachability 

reasoning is made up of the learning cycle and the reasoning cycle  (Ailiya et al., 2011). The 

learning cycle tracks the relationship links in the concept map where the learners are drawn 

in  to  the process to teach  the  teachable  agent, whereas  the  reasoning  cycle,  provides  the 

appropriate  responses  of  the  PTA  according  to  the  learnerâs  inquiry  of  the  learner  and 

reflect the responses in the environment.  

The persuasion cycle PPrA can be defined as:  

ï·  P,  Perceive:  Perceives  the  events  that  the 

learner  participates 

in  the 

environment. 

ï·  Pr, Persuasive Reasoning: Analyses the learnerâs motivation and ability towards 

teaching the PTA based on the participating events in the environment. 

ï·  A,  Action:  Generates  actions  to  encourage  change  in  learning  attitudes  and 

behaviours.  

 
 
 
 
The  diagram  in  Fig.  9  shows  that  the  Persuasive  Reasoning  uses  the  Elaboration 

Likelihood  Model  (ELM)  (Petty  &  Cacioppo,  1986)  theory  of    persuasion  as  its  theoretical 

basis.  The  Goal  Net  agent  model    (Zhiqi,  Chunyan,  Xuehong,  &  Robert,  2004)  is  used  to 

model  decision  process  in  which  the  PTA  selects  the  persuasive  strategies  it  takes  to 

influence the learners. The Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) (Kosko, 1986) computes the learnerâs 

motivation and ability parameters.  

In  the  following  section,  we  will  describe  the  theoretical,  agent  model  and 

computational model that the PTA is based on.  

Figure 9 Theoretical, Agent and Computational Models in Persuasive Reasoning 

3.1.1 Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion 

Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) is a well-established theories in the field of persuasion. 

ELM  uses  a  dualistic  approach,  modelling  attitude  change  through  central  and  peripheral 

routes (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986).  

According  to  ELM  ,  if  an  individual  is  motivated  and  has  the  ability  to  perform  a 

behaviour  he  or  she  is  likely  to  take  on  the  central  route  of  persuasion,  in  which  their 

change of attitude is more persistent. The individual is more likely to think deeply about the 

relevant issue. On the other hand, if one is less motivated and does not have the ability to 

perform  a  behaviour,  one  is  likely  to  adopt  the  peripheral  route  of  persuasion,  where 

attitude change is less enduring and one is less interested in elaborating on issues. 

 
 
 
 
 
 The PTA integrates the ELM persuasion theory to instil lasting attitude change towards 

learning  by  applying  appropriate  persuasive  strategies  based  on  the  learnerâs  motivation 

and ability levels. By categorizing events that occur in the environment, the PTA is able to 

determine  the  motivation  and  ability  level  based  on  the  usersâ  choices  to  participate  in 

events. 

Factors influencing motivation and abilities are selected based on the ELM to match the 

events in the environment. The following Table 5 shows the factors influencing motivation 

and ability in the PTA. 

Table 5 Factors Influencing Motivation and Ability based on ELM 

Factors influencing Motivation and Ability 

Motivation 

Ability 

Personal Relevance 
Personal Responsibility 
Need for cognition 
Prior Knowledge 
Distraction 
Repetition 

Motivation is assessed according to the personal relevance, personal responsibility and 

need  for  cognition  factors  derived  from  the  ELM  persuasion  theory.  These  motivation 

factors  correlate  to  events  that  the  user  participates  in  within  the  environment.  Personal 

relevance relates to how relevant the event is related to the learning topic for the learner. 

Personal responsibility relates to whether the event reflects the learnerâs responsibility for 

his or her learning. And the need for cognition factor reflects whether the learner is enjoying 

the learning process.  

 Ability is assessed through the events that correlate to prior knowledge, distraction and 

repetition  factors.  Prior  knowledge  determines  whether  the  learner  has  the  knowledge 

resources  required  to  teach  the  PTA.  Events  related  to  prior  knowledge  increase  the 

learnerâs  knowledge  so  they  can  be  better  equip  with  the  knowledge  to  teach  the  PTA. 

Distractions  are  events  that  reduce  the  learnerâs  ability  and  is  evaluated  based  on  the 

number  of  distracters  present  in  the  environment.  Because  repetition  increases  cognitive 

 
 
 
 
processing  ability  the  number  of  attempts  the  learner  teaches  the  PTA  determines  the 

learnerâs cognitive processing ability.  

The ELM is a useful framework in understanding the learner specifically what drive the 

learners to learn and their ability to perform the task in teaching and learning with the PTA, 

With  the  ELM  the  PTA  is  able  to  conceptualize  the  change  in  attitude  about  learning  in 

learners in terms of their motivation and ability.  

3.1.2 Goal Net Agent Model 

The persuasive reasoning component is based on a goal-oriented model for agent modelling 

known  as  Goal  Net  (Zhiqi,  2005;  Zhiqi  et  al.,  2004).  The  Goal  Net  is  composed  of  states 

represented  by  nodes  in  which  the  agents  need  to  complete  to  achieve  its  goal.  Fig  10 

shows an example illustration of the Goal Net model. 

Figure 10 Example Illustration of Goal Net 

The  transition  in  the  Goal  Net  model  is  represented  by  an  arc  with  vertical  bars,  that 

associates the task list and task function the agent has to complete to move on to the next 

state.  Arcs are represented by directed arrows that connect the relationship between states 

and  transitions.  A  composite  state  (shaded  node)  can  be  broken  down  into  atomic  states 

(blank node) which consist of a single state, via transitions. An agentâs goal within the Goal 

Net is to obtain an optimal state through the completion of sub-goals in a sequence. 

There are four temporal relationships during the transition between input and output 

states:  sequence,  choice,  concurrency  and  synchronization.  The  hierarchical  structure  of 

Goal Net allows for complex goal oriented models to be constructed using a composite of 

sub-goals.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sequence: is a direct causal relationship from state i to state i+1. 

Concurrency: is a simultaneous completion of tasks from state i. For example, state i+1 

and statei+2 can be achieved at the same time. 

Choice: is a selective connection from one state to other states. For example, state i+1 

and state  

Synchronization: is a convergent of multiple input states into a single output state. For 

example, state i and i +1 is converged to a single output state i+2. 

There are three types of transitions which are, direct, conditional, and probabilistic. 

Direct Transition: is represented by a vertical line, indicates that the input and output 

state  is  a  fix  action  or  sequence  of  actions  where  there  is  no  selection  mechanism 

involved.  

Conditional Transition: is represented by a diamond that indicates a transition after the 

completion of rule-based reasoning and selects actions according to runtime conditions. 

Probabilistic  Transition:  a  hexagon  represents  a  transition  that  uses  probabilistic 

inference to select actions in an uncertain situation.  

The  following  figure  is  a  n  example  illustration  of  the  Goal  Net  which  shows  the 

transitions between the sub-goals.  

Goal  Net  has  advantages  in  modelling  autonomous,  adaptive  agents  in  dynamic 

situations.  Therefore,  complex  goals  can  be  achieved  by  combining  multiple  sub-goals. 

Mental models of the agent as well as its implementation can be modelled with Goal Net. 

3.1.3 Fuzzy Cognitive Map Computational Model 

FCMs  were  first  proposed  by  Kosko  (1986)  to  represent  causal  relationships  with  fuzzy 

feedback in dynamic systems. A collection of concepts are interconnected to reflect cause-

effect relationships in the FCM dynamic system.  

Fig.  11  is  a  diagram  of  a  simple  FCM.  The  casual  relationships  in  the  FCM  are 

represented  by  links  between  nodes  (concepts)  and  directed  edges  (causal  relationships).  

 
 
 
 
 
The  weighted  causal  relationships  in  the  FCM  quantifies the  strength of  the  causal effects 

(Groumpos,  2010).    FCM  is  a  widely  accepted  method  to  model  interrelated  causal 

relationships between different factors affecting decisions in a visual graph representation.  

Figure 11 A Simple FCM, directed edge shows the causal flow between concept nodes. 

The  simplicity  and  flexibility  of  the  FCM  allows  it  to  be  applied  in  wide  variety  of 

applications.  Some  of  the  applications  FCM  include  expert  systems  that  solve  decision 

problems (Taber, 1991), in finance to solve stock investment analysis (Lee & Kim, 1997), in 

medical field (Stylios, Georgopoulos, Malandraki, & Chouliara, 2008). The FCM is particularly 

useful in structuring virtual worlds, due to its dynamic nature that allows changes over time 

(Dickerson & Kosko, 1993).   

In a simple FCM as shown in Fig 11, concept values Ci are values in real numbers [-1, 1] 

and the causal edges are values in [-1, 0, 1]. The edge matrix for the simple FCM in Fig. 11 is 

presented as connection matrix E listing the causal links between the nodes as shown in Fig. 

12:  

Figure 12 Connection matrix E shows the causal relationships in FCM. 

The  two  main  components  of  the  FCM  are  causal  concepts  and  causal  relationships. 

Causal  concepts  are  represented  by  nodes  which  can  model,  events,  actions,  goals  or 

lumped-parameter processes. While direct edges represent the causal relationships between 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concepts, a positive sign â+â stands for causal increase, whereas a negative sign â-â indicates 

a  causal  decrease.    Arbitrary  numbers  are  assigned  in  weighted  FCM  to  give  value  to  the 

increase  or  decrease  in  causal  strength.  The  causal  relationships  in  the  FCM  listed  as  a 

connection matrix that E between which concept node in ð¶ð (Dickerson & Kosko, 1993). The 
strength of the edges ððð of concept ð¶ð (ith column) takes on the value [-1, 1] which indicates 

negative  or  positive  causal  relationships.  For  example,  if  edge  ððð  is  negative,  -1, ð¶ð 

decreases ð¶ð. On the other hand, if edge ððð is positive, 1 ð¶ð increases ð¶ð.  

The  advantage  of  the  FCM  is  a  quick  and  easy  method  to  represent  and  acquire 

knowledge. Moreover, knowledge can be obtained from multiple expert sources and easily 

combined  into  a  single  FCM  without  restrictions  to  the  number  of  concepts.  FCM  can  be 

easily changed by adjusting the strength of the weights. It is also easy to modify changes in 

the model.  

As such, FCM is suitable to be applied in situation where human  behaviour is a major 

factor or where problems are complex due  to the large number of factors and there is no 

right  or  wrong  answers.  The  FCM  is  also  useful  when  limited  data  is  available,  missing  or 

incomplete (Ãzesmi & Ãzesmi, 2004). 

3.2  Persuasive Reasoning in PTA 

The persuasive reasoning component is based on a goal-oriented model for agent modelling 

know  as  Goal  Net  (Zhiqi  et  al.,  2004).  An  agentâs  goal  within  the  Goal  Net  is  to  obtain  an 

optimal state through the completion of sub-goals in a sequence. The fuzzy cognitive map 

transition in the Goal Net structure is used to translate the external states of the world and 

userâs activities into internal states that decide on the agents reactions in dynamic situations 

(Cai, Miao, Tan, & Shen, 2006). 

The goal of a PTA is to direct learners to stay on the central route of ELM with attitude 

change, where the receiverâs attitude changes towards an intended behaviour. In this case, 

the  persuasive  reasoning  Goal  Net  is  composed  using  the  Goal  Net,  FCM  and  the  ELM 

persuasion theory to persuade learners to teach the PTA. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.1 Persuasive Reasoning Goal Net 

The diagram in Fig. 13 shows the Persuasive Reasoning Goal Net. The Persuasive Reasoning 

Goal  Net  receives  events  from  the  events  tracker  once  the  agent  encounters  the  learner. 

Once the events from the environment have been received, the Persuasive FCM is activated 

as a transition in the Goal Net.  

Figure 13 Persuasive Reasoning Goal Net. 

In Fig. 13 the Persuasive FCM is shown as the fuzzy cognitive map transition in the Goal 

Net structure translates external states of the world and users activities into internal states 

that  decides  the  agents  reactions  in  dynamic  situations  (Cai  et  al.,  2006).  The  Goal  Net 

structure provides temporal control over events that occur within the dynamic environment 

while  the  fuzzy  cognitive  map  handles  the  internal  reasoning  based  on  the  influence  of 

external  environmental  factors.  The  outcome  is  a  fuzzy  cognitive  Goal  Net  reasoning  that 

uses  external  events  as  a  basis  to  model  complex  internal  states  of  the  agent.  The  agent 

then proceeds select and persuasion strategies and execute actions in the environment.    

If  the  learner  possess  both  motivation  and  ability  to  teach  the  agent  the  persuasive 

reasoning ends. If the learner has low ability and/or low motivation, the persuasion strategy 

planner will be activated. The appropriate peripheral cue is selected based on the studentâs 

motivation  or  ability  and  actions  are  carried out  in  the  environment,  once  the  actions  are 

carried out the PTA persuasive reasoning returns to its initial state. 

 
 
 
 
 
3.2.2 Persuasive FCM 

External events influence the learnerâs motivation and ability in teaching the PTA. Thus, the 

PTA needs to understand the events in the environment and how each event influences the 

motivation and ability of the learners to learn and teach the teachable agent. The concept 

value  of  motivation  and  ability  enables  the  PTA  to  select  the  appropriate  persuasion 

strategy and action to act upon in the environment.  

According to ELM persuasion theory, motivation is influenced by personal relevance to 

the  issue, personal responsibility and  oneâs need for  cognition.  The ability  to elaborate on 

the  issue  depends  on  the  presence  of  distracters.  The  learnerâs  ability  to  participate  in  an 

event also depends on the repetition to the task and prior knowledge to the issue.  

The Persuasive Fuzzy Cognitive Map (Persuasive FCM) is a fuzzy map based on the ELM 

persuasion  theory  that  shows  the  causal  relationships  between  external  events.  Factors 

affecting  motivation  and  ability  that  influence  the  PTAâs  actions  are  based  on  the  ELM 

theory  of  persuasion.  The  final  persuasive  FCM  consists  of  the  persuasive  FCM  with 

weighted edges. The initial Persuasive FCM was designed based on the case study on Virtual 

Singapura (VS).  

 
 
 
 
 
Figure 14 Causal relationships between external events and peripheral cue. 

The  learning  motivation  and  ability  to  encourage  students  to  teach  the  PTA  are 

affected  by  the  external  events  that  the  learners  engage  in  within  the  VS  learning 

environment,  where  the  dotted  nodes  representing  the  external  events  that  are  causally 

linked  with  directed  edges.  The  peripheral  cues  indicated  with  a  shaded  node  in  the 

Persuasive  FCM  represents  the  actions  initiated  by  the  PTA.  Fig.  14  is  the  graphical 

representation  of  the  Persuasive  FCM  that  shows  the  causal  relationships  between  the 

external events and the peripheral cue.   

The  Persuasive  FCM  is  based  on  the  findings  during  the  field  study  of  VS  learning 

environment  in  local  secondary  schools.  The  causal  relationships  that  are  interlinked 

between  external  events  and  factors  influenced  both  motivation  and  ability,  and  these 

relationships are crucial for the PTA to determine the types of peripheral cues that that the 

agent  performs  the  environment,  as  some  of  the  peripheral  cues  provided  by  the  PTA 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
influences the decision of students to learn and teach the PTA in the learning.  The following 

is the definition of the Persuasive FCM. 

The Persuasive FCM is defined as a set of ð¶ðððððð¡ =   {ð¶1, ð¶2, â¦ , ð¶ð} where,

The external events in the environment that student learner participates in that determines 

his or her motivation and ability.  RL,  RS  and  NC are  event sets that are linked to personal 

relevance,  personal  responsibility  and  need  for  cognition  respectively  affecting  an 

individualâs  motivation.  And  PK,  DT,  RP,  refers  to  prior  knowledge,  distracters  and 

repetition event sets that affect an individualâs ability to perform a task. Each external event 

n is given an initial state value [0], as the student learner participates in a particular event 

the state value of event n becomes [1]. 

Within each event sets there are n number of events,

ExpertHintsSet,  EH  contains  a  set  of  hints  from  expert  source  that  the  teachable  agent 

provides  to  help  student  learner  overcome  difficulties  during  the  teaching  process  where, 

ð¬ð¯ =   {ð¸ð»1, ð¸ð»2  â¦ ð¸ð»ð }

Each  item,  n  from  the  ES,  AS  and  AF  takes  on  a  value  of  [1,  0],  and  is  activated  when  a 

peripheral  cue  have  been  selected  and  carried  out  in  the  virtual  environment.  The  state 

value of motivation, Mott at time t is the sums of RS, RL, NC state vectors, multiply by their 

respective  weight  value  of  WRS,  WRL,  and  WNC.  Similarly,  state  values  of  ability  and 

peripheral cue, Abt and PeriCuet are the result of the sum of individual state vectors multiply 

by their respective weight values.

Where At+1 is the new state vector of concepts Ci and Cj, and A t is the previous state vector

3.2.3 Persuasive Strategy Planner 

In the Persuasive Strategy Planner sub-goal shown in Fig. 15, the PTA selects the persuasion 

strategy  based  on  the  motivation  and  ability  values  from  the  Persuasive  FCM.  Once  the 

persuasive strategy to improve motivation or ability is selected, a peripheral cue is selected 

in  the  Persuasion  Strategy  Selection  sub-goal.  The  peripheral  cues  are  based  on  the  ELM 

(Cacioppo  et  al.,  1986)  theory  of  persuasion,  where  individual  under  the  peripheral  route 

are influenced by attractive expert source, or strong arguments and affect.  

Figure 15 Persuasion Strategy Planner sub-goal of the Persuasive Reasoning Goal Net. 

 
 
 
 
3.2.4 Persuasive Strategy Selection 

In  the  Persuasive  Strategy  Selection  sub-goal  shown  in  Fig.  16,  the  persuasive  strategy  is 

selected based on the motivation and ability value. If either motivation or ability value is low, 

a suitable peripheral cue is selected.  The persuasive action is generated and executed in the 

environment. 

Figure 16 Persuasion Strategy Selection sub-goal of the Persuasion Strategy Planner 

3.3  Preliminary Experimental Results  

The  persuasive  FCM  model  based  on  the  VS  project  is  simulated  in  the  following  scenario 

examples that demonstrate the Persuasive FCM model. This simulation was conducted using 

the  Fuzzy  Cognitive  Mapping  software  (FCMapper).  The  FCMapper  is  an  Excel  based  FCM 

analysis tool freely available (Skinner, 1938).    

Experiment  1:  Learner  A  engages  in  a  series  of  events  involving  gradually  change  personal 

relevance by gradually applying diffusion, osmosis and evaporation.

As  shown  in  Table  6,  the  increase  in  concept  value  of  the  personal  relevance 

corresponds to the increase in the concept value of motivation and ability. As the student 

 
 
 
 
learnerâs  motivation  and  ability  increases,  the  peripheral  cue  needed  to  stimulate  interest 

decreases gradually. Based on the concept values of motivation, ability and peripheral cue 

from  the  Persuasive  FCM  iteration,  the  PTA  will  determine  the  persuasion  strategy  to 

execute in the sub-goal of the Persuasive Reasoning in the previous section. 

3.3.1 Illustrative Example 

The  following  section  is  a  description  on  events  that  the  learner  can  participate  in,  and  is 

tracked  using  the  Persuasive  Reasoning  Goal  Net.  Once  an  event  is  received,  motivation, 

ability and peripheral cue values are extracted from Persuasive FCM. Actions based on the 

values derived from the Persuasive FCM are executed by the PTA with the aim to persuade 

the learner in teaching the PTA.  

In  the  initial  process,  the  PTA  receives  events  that  the  learner  participates  in  the 

learning environment.  

Receive Events: 

1.  Flying/swimming in the environment 

2.  Learn diffusion and osmosis (Knowledge Farm) 

3.  Apply osmosis and diffusion (Virtual Laboratory) 

4.  Teach teachable agent (Save banana plant quest) 

Check Motivation: 

The  result  of  the  motivation  values  after  each  event  is  shown  in  Table  6.  There  is  an 

increase in motivation value after each event.  

Check Ability: 

The result of the Ability values after each event. 

Execute Persuasion Strategy Planner: 

Peripheral  cue  values  are  extracted  from  the  Persuasive  FCM  as  shown  in  Table  6.  In 

this case, a higher value of the peripheral cue indicates that the PTA needs to persuade the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
learner  more.  For  example,  if  the  peripheral  cue  value  is  high,  the  emotions  of  the 

Persuasive Teachable Agent will be activated from the AffectSet, AF which returns the âsadâ 

emotions. Therefore, the persuasive actions for the PTA will be to execute a âcryâ animation.  

3.3.2 Discussion on Issues and Challenges  

In  comparison  to  the  existing  teachable  agent, the  improved PTA  is  able  to  respond  more 

intuitively to suit the studentâs learning requirements. Learners are motivated to teach the 

PTA. The improved PTA is able to respond better to individual needs of the learner based on 

their ability and motivation. At the same time, the PTA possesses the capability to provide 

strategies to encourage social interaction which will keep learners engaged while teaching 

the PTA.  

Although  this  initial  PTA  model  addresses  the  issues  in  teachable  agent,  namely,  the 

lack of interaction between the teachable agent and the learners. However, this version of 

the PTA model still poses several limitations, as highlighted in the review of the initial of the 

PTA model  (Zeng, 2015).  

Firstly, the design of the initial PTA model focuses on the implementation of persuasion 

theory onto the teachable agent model, which improves the ability of the PTA to persuade 

the  learners  to  teach  it.  However,  the  initial  PTA  model  lacks  integration  of  the  agentâs 

ability to practice on the knowledge taught by the learner. Moreover, in terms of reusability, 

the  initial  PTA  model  adopts  a  quantitative  model  that  was  difficult  to  reuse  in  terms  of 

computational  processes.  Lastly,  the  initial  PTA  model  was  largely  based  on  theoretical  a 

model  which  presents  a  gap  in  the  practical  implementation  of  the  PTA  model  in  a  real 

world game engine.   

3.4  Improvements to the PTA  

Zeng (2015) further suggested the following improvements to the original version of the 

PTA model which includes a complete integration of the Persuasion Reasoning, Teachability 

Reasoning and Practicability Reasoning. The original Persuasion Reasoning is simplified and 

fully  combined  with  the  Teachability  Reasoning  and  Practicability  Reasoning.  The 

Teachability  Reasoning  and  Practicability  Reasoning  have  been  added  to  the  improved 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Persuasive Goal Net to reflect on the PTAâs ability to be taught and practice the knowledge 

taught  by  the  learner.  An  improved  version  of  the  PTA  model  allows  for  a  reusable 

quantitative  model  where  the  Persuasion  Reasoning  model  that  could  be  applied  to 

different contexts. This means that future applications of the  Persuasion Reasoning can be 

reused  in  other  knowledge  domains  and  implementations  in  future  work.  And  a  refined 

version  of  the  system  architecture  that  describes  the  implementation  of  the  reusable  PTA 

control structures are proposed and developed in a 3D virtual environment.  

3.4.1 Redefining PTA Model 

The  improved  PTA  model  shown  in  Fig.  17  is  proposed  by,  Zeng  (2015)  is  redefined  by  a 

tuple: 

PTA = (E, ET, K, Rs, R, A) 

Figure 17 Improved PTA Model (Zeng, 2015) 

-  E, Environment 

ï·  The set of environments states perceived by the agent. 

-  ET, Precepts /Events Tracker 

ï·  The set of precepts or events that the agent perceives from the environment. 

-  K, Knowledge Base 

 
 
 
 
 
ï·  The knowledge base of the agent, which consists of the following subset. 

ï§  Goal  Net Model,  is the  set  of  Goal Net  structures  which  controls  the 
  characteristics and drives the agent towards its goals pursuit  

ï§  FCM  Model,  stores  the  FCM  structure  that  derives  the  values  of 
  motivation and ability. 

ï§  Domain  Knowledge,  stores  the  expert  knowledge  related  to  the 

learning topics. 

ï§  Learnt  Knowledge,  stores  the  knowledge  that  the  agent  learnt  from 
the knowledge taught 

ï§  Runtime  Data,  stores  data  such  as  the  events  information  and  their 
history that is generated during runtime.  

-  Rs, Reasoning Selection 

ï·  The selection mechanism set the agent has to adopt to select reasoning in R 

for each cycle. 

-  R, Reasoning Set 

ï·  The  set  of  reasoning  for  the  agent  to  perform,  which  and  can  be  further 

defined by the tuple: R = (P, Tr, Pr) where,  

ï§  P, is the Persuasion Reasoning mechanism that enables the agent to 

persuade the learner. 

ï§  Tr, is the Teachability Reasoning that allows the agent to learn from 

the knowledge taught. 

ï§  Pr, is the Practicability Reasoning that allows the agent to practice on 

the knowledge learnt.  

-  A, Actions 

ï·  The set of actions to be performed by the agent in the environment. 

In addition, the improved PTA model enables the agent to through the following three 

different cycles: 

ï·  Persuasion Cycle: EtRsP(KA) 

1.  Perceive: The agentâs perceptions on the events in the environment 

 
 
 
 
 
2.  Reasoning  Selection:  The  agent  selects  a  suitable  reasoning 

according to its perceptions 

3.  Persuasion  Reasoning:  The  agent  goes  through  reasoning  to 
determinate  the  type  persuasion  based  on  the  learnerâs  level  of 
motivation  and  ability.  The  agent  then  selects  the  appropriate 
persuasion cue according to its perception if persuasion is required. 

4.  Knowledge  Base:  The  agent  retrieves  the  persuasion  cue  from  the 

knowledge base if persuasion is required. 

5.  Action:  The  agent  executes  the  persuasion  cue  if  persuasion  is 

required.  

ï·  Teaching Cycle: EtRsTrK 

1.  Perceive: The agentâs perceptions on the events in the environment 

2.  Reasoning  Selection:  The  agent  selects  a  suitable  reasoning 

according to its perceptions 

3.  Teachability  Reasoning:  The  agent  acquires  the  knowledge  taught 
and through its teachability reasoning, interprets the knowledge into 
knowledge representations. 

4.  Knowledge  Base:  The  agent  stores  the  interpreted  knowledge 

representation in the knowledge base.  

ï·  Practicing  Cycle: EtRsPr(KA)  

1.  Perceive: The agentâs perceptions on the events in the environment 

2.  Reasoning  Selection:  The  agent  selects  a  suitable  reasoning 

according to its perceptions 

3.  Practicability  Reasoning:  The  agent  decides  the  appropriate 
responses  to  the  learnerâs  queries  according  to  its  knowledge.  The 
agent  chooses  a  response  if  correct  response  if  the  responses  are 
pre-determined.  

4.  Knowledge  Base:  The  agent  retrieves  the  response  from  the 

knowledge base if the response is pre-determined.  

5.  Action: The agent response according to the learnerâs query.  

 
 
 
The  improved  PTA  model  based  on  the  earlier  proposed  PTA  architecture  offers  a 

clearer  view  of  the  agent  reasoning  capabilities  and  flexibility  for  the  PTA  to  select  its 

reasoning functions according to its precepts of the environment, thus, allowing the PTA to 

be more autonomous.  

3.4.2 Modelling Teachability and Practicability Reasoning with Goal Net 

 Significant  additions  to  the  PTA  architecture  are  the  Teachability  Reasoning  and 

Practicability  Reasoning  in  the  R,  Reasoning  Set  cycle.  The  Teachability  Reasoning  and 

Practicability  Reasoning  is  modelled  with  the  Goal  Net  agent  model  and  integrated  in  the 

Goal Net model of  PTA (Zeng, 2015), which forms the highest level of the Goal Net in the 

PTA known as the main routine shown in Fig. 18.  

Figure 18 Goal Net Model of PTA Main Routine (Zeng, 2015) 

The  following  Table  7  shows  the  PTA  definition  and  the  corresponding  states  and 

transitions in the main routine in Fig.18.

To Persuade 

The main  routine  runs  continuously  as long  as the  agent  continues to  pursue  its  goal. 

The  agent  will  check  for  an  update  of  events  in  each  cycle.  If  one  or  more  events  are 

detected,  it  will  select  the  reasoning  based  on  the  events  perceived.  After  each  cycle,  the 

agent will return to its original start node and begins a new cycle. 

There are three sub-goals, namely, Teachability Reasoning, Practicability Reasoning and 

Persuasion Reasoning in the main routine. These sub-goals allow for the agent to select the 

appropriate reasoning goals according to the events in environment.  

Teachability Reasoning Sub-Goal  

The  Teachability  Reasoning  sub-goal  in  Fig.  19  illustrates  the  agentâs  desire  to  learn  new 

knowledge.  In  this  sub-goal,  the  agent  requires  the  learner  user  to  teach  itself.  Once  the 

response  has  been  received  by  the  agent,  it  checks  if  the  request  have  been  accepted  or 

rejected.  If  the  learner  agrees  to  teach  the  agent,  the  goal  net  initiates  teaching.  Once 

teaching has been initialized the agent acquires the knowledge after it saves the stored the 

knowledge received and the cycle ends. 

Figure 19 Teachability Reasoning Sub-Goal Net (Zeng, 2015) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Practicability Reasoning Sub-Goal Net 

The  Practicability  Reasoning  sub-goal  in  Fig.  20  starts  with  the  agentâs  query  in  its 

knowledge base which retrieves the knowledge that it has learnt from the learner. Through 

its reasoning, the agent generates either a correct solution or a wrong solution based on the 

knowledge in its knowledge base.  

This simulates the agentâs capability to practice its knowledge and provides a means for 

the agent to reflect on the knowledge learnt through feedback on the learnersâ teaching.  If   

the result from the reasoning is the correct solution,  the agent will carry out the solution. 

On the other hand,  if the result of the reasoning is a wrong solution event, upon the next 

cycle of the Goal Net of PTA, the agent will go through the Persuasion Reasoning Goal Net in 

the attempt to improve the learnerâs motivation.  

Figure 20 Practicability Reasoning Sub-Goal Net (Zeng, 2015) 

Persuasion Reasoning Sub-Goal Net 

 The  Persuasion  Reasoning  Sub-Goal  shown  in  Fig,  21,  is  adapted  from  the  Persuasive 

Reasoning  Goal  Net.  In  this  sub-goal,  the  goal  of  the  agent  is  to  persuade  the  learner  to 

improve their ability and motivation.  

 
 
 
 
 
Figure 21 Persuasion Reasoning Sub-Goal Net (Zeng, 2015) 

Similar to the Persuasive Reasoning Goal Net, the Persuasion Reasoning Sub-Goal starts 

with the calculation in the Persuasive FCM. Following that, learnerâs motivation and ability 

are assessed. The agent then selects a reasoning based on the level of motivation and ability 

by comparing the results to predetermine the baseline values. If both motivation and ability 

is high, the cycle ends and no further actions are required. If  either motivation or ability is 

low,  the  agent  will  then  select  an  appropriate  persuasion  cue  that  aims  to  improve  the 

learnerâs  motivation  and  ability  and  execute  the  cue.  The  Persuasion  Reasoning  Sub-Goal 

Net  will  end  after  the  cues  have  been  executed  and  return  the  next  node  in  the  main 

routine.    

3.4.3 Quantitative Modelling of the Persuasive FCM 

To facilitate the computational processes Zheng (2015) had suggested separating Persuasive 

FCM to form a Main FCM and the Sub FCM as shown in Fig. 22.  

 
 
 
 
 
Figure 22 Remodelled Persuasive FCM (Zeng, 2015) 

The  Main  FCM  is  formed  by the  stem  nodes  made  up  of  the  causal  concepts  namely, 

peripheral  cue,  as  well  as,  motivation  and  ability  which  are  connected  to  the  factors  that 

affect  the  input  of  motivation  and  ability  forms  the  stem  nodes.    In  addition  to  the  Main 

FCM, the Sub FCM is connected to the stem nodes. Multiple are leaf nodes (dotted circles) 

are  attached  to  the  stem,  each  leaf  node  an  event  in  the  environment  that  has  direct 

influence to the any of the input factors related to motivation and ability.  

The  improved  Persuasive  FCM  model  allows  for  greater  flexibility  and  computational 

efficiency if future events in the environment were to be added, as these events could be 

included in the leaf nodes. 

3.4.4 PTA System Architecture Design 

To  further  close  gap  between  the  theoretical  model  and  the  implementation  of  the  PTA, 

Zheng (2015), proposed an improved version of the PTA system architecture. The improved 

system  architecture  is  more  flexible  as  it  is  independent  of  the  topics  of  learning.  The 

embodiment of the PTA is not restricted and it can be deployed and implemented in other 

environments.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 23 Improved PTA System Architecture Design (Zeng, 2015) 

The  following  Table  8  shows  the  components  in  the  PTA  system  architecture  and  its 

corresponding functionalities and roles.  

Table 8 Functionalities and Roles of Components in PTA System Architecture 

Components 

Functionality/Role 

Goal  Net Interpreter 

Control the goal-oriented behaviours of the PTA. 

PTA Control 

Event Control 

Implement functions, coordinate PTA goal-oriented

UI Control 

Data Access 

 Goal Net Interpreter 

Control the interface elements in the PTA 
environment. 

Connects to the database and performs queries. 

At the top level of the PTA system architecture is the Goal Net Interpreter. The purpose of 

the  Goal  Net  Interpreter  is  to  control  the  goal-oriented  behaviours  of  the  PTA  through  its 

 
 
 
 
  
reasoning cycle. The Goal Net models in the PTA are created in the Goal Net Designer (Han, 

Zhiqi, & Chunyan, 2007) and stored in the Goal Net database.  

The main purpose of the Goal Net Interpreter is to load the saved Goal Net models from 

the Goal net database and interpret the Goal Net models dynamically in real-time. The Goal 

Net  Interpreter  also determines the  tasks  the  PTA  was  to  perform  so  as  to pursue  it  goal, 

during  the  state  transition  in  the  main  route  of  the  PTA  Goal  Net.  After  the  tasks  are 

determined,  the  Goal  Net  Interpreter  then  updates  the  PTA  Control  to  perform  the  tasks 

assigned.  

PTA Control 

The role of the PTA control is to implement the functionalities in the PTA. The PTA Control 

performs the task functions shown in Table 9 by acting upon the instructions from the Goal 

Net Interpreter. This is done by breaking down the tasks into tasks and sub-tasks and sends 

them to other components by calling on the corresponding modules in  these components, 

so that the components are able to work together towards the goal of the PTA.

For the PTA to realize the three reasoning cycles in the PTA definition, the PTA Control 

has to implement the task functions that are associated with the transitions in the PTA Goal 

Net models. The following are the Goal Net models in the PTA and their associated functions 

to be implemented by the PTA Control. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Event Control 

The Event Control corresponds to the Event Tracker ET in the PTA definition. It handles the 

lifetime of an event such as the creation, logging, processing and removal of events. The PTA 

Control also uses the Event Control to handle events in the PTA Goal Net model. 

The  Event  Control  keeps  track  of  the  events  by  checking  for  new  events  at 

predetermined  intervals  and  log  newly  generated  events    in  the  Event  Log  in  the  Event 

Control. The Event Control prioritizes the events and determines the processing sequence of 

the events when the checking is performed as well as decides on the number of interaction 

events to process in batches.  

The  Table  10  below  shows  the  event  category  and  the  examples  of  the  few  types  of 

events that can be tracked in the PTA environment.

FCM Calculation 

The  FCM  Calculation  component  processes  the  computational  aspects  in  the  Persuasion 

Reasoning in the PTA. The FCM model is loaded from the database and stored in the FCM 

Calculation  component  when  the  PTA  is  initialized,  the  PTA  Control  actives  the  FCM 

Calculation in the Persuasion Reasoning Cycle to compute the motivation and ability values.  

UI Control 

The  UI  Control  component  provides  the  module  that  enables  the  agent  to  perform  the 

actions as defined in the PTA definition in the environment. This includes the embodiment 

of  the  PTA  in  the  environment  either  as  a  2D  or  3D  avatar.  The  UI  Control  allows  for  the 

learner user the graphical interface to control the PTA in the environment.   

Database Access 

The Database Access component allows for the other components to access the database. 

Multiple databases may be accessed through the Database Access component. For example 

the Goal Net Interpreter is able to access the state and transitions in the Goal Net database. 

Another example  is  when  the  FCM  Calculation  component  loads  the  FCM  model from the 

FCM database.   

3.4.5 Discussion on the Improvements to the PTA 

To  summarise  the  improvements  to the  PTA,  the  reasoning  component  to the  PTA  is  fully 

integrated  with  the  combination  Persuasion  Reasoning,  Teachability  Reasoning  and 

Practicability. The Persuasion Reasoning is simplified with a quantitative model allowing the 

PTA  to  be  used  in  different  contexts.  This  allows  greater  flexibility  for  the  PTA  to  be 

deployed in other applications platforms in the future.  

The  improved  system  architecture  provides  better  controls  for  the  PTA  to  handle 

multiple functionalities and prepare the PTA for deployment in the applications such as the 

3D game engine, which will be discussed further in the following section.   

3.5  Implementation of PTA in Virtual Singapura (VS) Saga 

 
 
 
 
  In  this  section,  the  implementation  of  the  PTA  in  a  3D  game  engine  will  be  discussed  in 

detail.  

Firstly,  the  Unity  3D  game  engine  in  which  the  PTA  is  deployed  will  be  introduced, 

followed by a walk-through of the Virtual Singapura (VS) Saga storyline. The walk-though of 

VS will serve as a guide on how the PTA will be used by the learner to simulate learning-by-

teaching with the PTA.  

3.5.1 Developing VS Saga using Unity 3D Game Engine 

The VS Saga is developed in the Unity 3D game engine, which is an easy to use, multi-

platform  game  engine.  This  allows  for  applications  to  be  created  for  mobile  devices,  PC, 

consoles and websites. The PTA is implemented in the Unity 3D game engine using the PTA 

model and system architecture.    

3.5.2 Virtual Singapura (VS) Saga Storyline  

The  VS  Saga  3D  virtual  learning  environment  (VLE)  is  developed  for  lower  secondary  level 

science  learning.  Fig.  24  shows  the  screenshot  of  the  main  navigation  interface  of  the  VS 

saga. 

Figure 24  Main navigation in VS Saga  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Unlike  the  previous  version  of  VS,  the  VS  Saga  is  a  three  part  learning  journey  that 

follows the storyline of the avatar of the player who is the learner helping the town dwellers 

on an island by completing a series of missions. Through the completion of these missions, 

the learner will be able to learn science concepts. Towards the end of the mission they will 

be  able  to  teach  the  PTA  that  is  embodied  by  a  water  molecule.  Having  taught  the  water 

molecule PTA, the water molecule will be able to travel into a sick banana plant, thus saving 

it from dying.  

The VS Saga consists of a three-part storyline, namely, the knowledge town, the science 

laboratory and the tree scenes. Details on each part of the storyline will be introduced in the 

following section.  

Knowledge Town 

Figure 25 Knowledge town in VS Saga 

The knowledge town is where the learner takes on the role as the player avatar that has just 

landed  on  the  island,  as  shown  in  Fig.25.  The  learner  will  meet  the  water  molecule  PTA 

which then informs him or her about the need to learn more about science topics such as 

osmosis  an  diffusion  by  visiting  exploring  the  island  to  meet  other  non-player  characters 

 
 
 
 
 
 
(NPC)s.  In  the  process  of  talking  to  different  characters  the  learner  will  be  able  pick  up 

information on the transportation of water molecules within a plant.  

Throughout the knowledge town, there are also NPCs that are not related to learning. 

These NPCs are intentionally included in the scene to distract the learner players from their 

learning.  Table  12  shows  the  sequence  of  storyline  and  interaction  between  the  learner 

player avatar and the NPCs.  

The  objective  of  the  PTA  is  to  encourage  the  learner  player  to  stay  on  their  learning 

tasks and complete their mission by talking to NPCs  regarding information related to their 

learning mission. In order to achieve to this, the PTA will have to go through its Persuasive 

Reasoning  to  understand  the  learner  playerâs  motivation  and  ability,  thus  allowing  it  to 

apply  appropriate  persuasion  cues.  The  persuasion  cues  given  by  the  PTA  are  aimed  at 

influencing the learner playerâs decision to stay on track in completing their learning mission.

Science Laboratory 

After  learning  the  related  information  from  the  NPCs  in  the  knowledge  town,  the  learner 

player proceeds to the science laboratory as shown in Fig. 26. The science laboratory allows 

the learner to practice on the knowledge and information that the learner  has acquired in 

the knowledge town.  

 
 
 
 
 
Figure 26 Science laboratory in VS Saga  

The learn player can interact with new NPCs at the science laboratory. There is also a 

diffuser  where  the  learner  player  can  simulate  the  movement  of  the  molecule  particles 

during the osmosis and diffusion process through a series of experiments. This in turn helps 

the  learner  play  to  further  retain  their  knowledge  that  they  have  learnt  in  the  knowledge 

island  scene.  Table  12  shows  the  sequence  in  which  the  learner  player  avatar  has  to

3.6  PTA in VS Saga 

The  PTA  has  several  controls  that  manage  its  task  functionalities.  In  this  section,  the 

functionalities in the PTA Control, UI Control and Event Control will be discussed according 

to the context in VS saga.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
3.6.1 PTA Control 

Main Routine 

When  the  Main  Routine  is  executed,  the  PTA  control  activates  the  Event  Control  every  5 

seconds  so  as  to  check  for  events.  If  one  or  more  events  are  detected,  the  Main  Routine 

decides on the events that are to be processed first in the current cycle and determines the 

reasoning cycle the events should go through.  

Persuasion Reasoning 

If  the  Persuasion  Reasoning  Sub-Goal  Net  is  activated  the  FCM  calculation  will  determine 

the ability and motivation based on the events in VS saga. The values will be compared with 

the pre-determined baseline values to evaluate if the motivation or the ability levels are low. 

If  these  values  are  lower  than  the  baseline  values  persuasion  cues  will  be  activated  and 

executed  through  the  UI  controls.  This  is  when  the  PTA  control  calls  on  the  UI  control  to 

display the persuasion cues in the VS saga.  

Happy 

Neutral 

Sad 

Shocked 

Figure 28 Facial expressions and emotion persuasion cues in PTA 

Persuasion cues in VS saga includes facial expressions showing affect or emotions in the 

PTA  water  molecule  NPC  as  shown  in  Fig.  28.  As  well  as  dialogue  speech  displays  such  as 

hints  from  expert  source  or  advice  from  attractive  source  that  adheres  to  the  ELM 

persuasion theory.  An example of the PTA emotion and speech persuasion cue is shown in 

Fig. 29. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 29 PTA emotion and speech persuasion cue displayed 

Teachability Reasoning 

The  teaching  process  starts  when  the  PTA  requests  the  learner  to  teach  itself  through 

dialogue. Once the request has been accepted by the learner, the PTA control will call the UI 

control  to  active  the  concept  map,  a  graphical  tool  that  helps  students  organise  and 

visualise  relationships  between  concepts  in  knowledge  of  a  subject.  Fig.  30  shows  the 

screenshot in which the PTA requests the learner for teaching. 

Figure 30 PTA requesting learner for teaching 

 
 
 
 
 
The concept map will be displayed in the interface in VS saga, as shown in Fig. 31. The 

learner  is  required  to  complete  the  concept  map  in  order  to  teach  the  PTA.  If  the  learner 

rejects teaching the PTA, PTA control then generates a rejection event.  

Figure 31 Concept map that require the learner to complete 

Practicability Reasoning 

In  the  Practicability  Reasoning  Sub-Goal  Net,  the  PTA  reasons  on  the  knowledge  that  the 

learner  has  taught  the  PTA.  This  will  determine  whether  the  knowledge  is  correct.  If  the 

knowledge  is  correct,  the  PTA  Control  will  generate  an  animation  to  show  the  ârevivalâ of 

the  dying  banana  plant, signifying that the  PTA molecule  has  gained  the  information  from 

the  learner  to  enter  the  roots  of  the  banana  plant  to  transport  essential  water  for  the 

plantâs  survival.  In  the  case  where  the  knowledge  taught  is  incorrect  the  PTA  control  will 

generate the events through the UI control to display a message to tell the learner to repeat 

the teaching event.  

3.6.2 UI Control 

The UI control is a component that manages the displays of and user interface (UI) in the VS 

saga game. 

 
 
 
 
 
One example is the PTA panel that is an interface for the Persuasion Reasoning in the 

PTA to  display  persuasion  cue.  Whenever  a persuasion  cue  is  selected  through Persuasion 

Reasoning, the PTA Control will activate the UI Control to display the information selected of 

the selected cue.  

The  concept  map  is  where  the  learner  player  teaches  the  PTA.  The  learner  player 

completes the teaching process by dragging the buttons selections on the left and dropping 

them in the blank spaces in the concept map. When they click on the âTeach!â button, the 

contents in the blank spaces will be saved by the UI Control as knowledge learnt by the PTA 

and a new event will be created for the completion of the teaching process.  

Figure 32 Banana plant after the PTA has been taught by the learner 

The  last  example  is  the  banana  plant  interface.  If  the  learner  player  has  successfully 

taught  the  PTA  correctly,  the  UI  Control  changes  the  colour  and  rotation  of  the  leaves  to 

simulate an animated revival of the dying banana plant, as shown in Fig. 32.   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.6.3  

 Event Control  

The Event Control in the VS saga is a supportive controller for events that support the PTA 

control. There are three types of events that the Event Control tracks in the VS saga, namely 

the Time Events, Dialogue Events and Teaching Feedback Events.  

Dialogue Events  

A  dialogue  event  is  created  whenever  there  is  a  dialogue  between  the  learner  player  and 

the NPCs. These dialogue events are created in the dialogue system in the Unity 3D game 

engine using the SequencerCommand script. Both learner player and the NPCs dialogues can 

be setup in the dialogue system. A new dialogue can be created and added to the event log 

with the event control.  

Time Events 

The  Event  Control  tracks  the  duration  in  which  the  learner  player  is  inactive  in  the  Time 

Event.  This  is  done  with  a  timer that  keeps  track  of  the  amount of  time  the  learner  is  not 

engaging  with learning activities by interacting with  the  NPCs  in the  VS  saga.  If  a  dialogue 

event  is  detected,  the  timer  will  be  reset.  In  case  of  a  time-out  a  time  event  will  be 

generated which indicates that the learner player is inactive in the VS saga.  

Teaching Feedback Events 

The teaching feedback event provides feedback to the learner playerâs teaching. Two main 

events are tracked by the Event Control in VS Saga. Namely, the teach success event and the 

teach failure event.   

Events Tracked in VS Saga 

Various events are tracked in the VS saga. The table below is a list of events that are tracked 

in the VS saga. These events are used by the Event Control to generate responses in the PTA.  

Table 14 Events Tracked in VS Saga

Teaching Events 

1.  Teach success 
2.  Teach Failure 

In  addition  to  the  events  in  the  table  above,  the  practicability  event  is  also  tracked. 

However,  this  does  not  belong  to  any  of  the  categories  in  the  Event  Control,  as  the 

practicability event does not generate any dialogue in the VS saga.   

3.6.4 Persuasive FCM in VS Saga 

The  events  tracked  in  VS  saga  are  categorised  into  the  leaf  nodes  of  the  Persuasive  FCM 

based on the ELM persuasion. Fig. 33 shows the complete FCM in the VS saga complete with 

events tracked. Note that only events that affect the motivation and ability are included in 

the leaf nodes of the Persuasive FCM.

3.7  Studies during Formative Assessment of the PTA Model 

Several case studies were conducted throughout the development of the PTA in VS in this 

section. The following are the descriptions of the case studies conducted from the year 2013 

to 2015. 

A  preliminary  study  was  conducted  in  2013  on  the  VS  test  platform  for  the  initial 

assessment of the PTA model (Lim, Ailiya, Miao, & Shen, 2013). An interview was conducted 

on two groups of testers who interacted with a version of VS. The control group tested on a 

version  of  the  VS  with  a  teachable  agent  without  persuasion  and  compared  with  the 

treatment  group  who  tested  version  of  VS  with  the  PTA  prototype.  The  initial  results 

showed that treatment group of testers responded that they are more willing to teach the 

PTA during the learning process compared to the responses from the control group.  

In  2014,  a  separate  study  with  a  clearer  model  for  Persuasive  Goal  Net  allowing  for 

tracking on the userâs learning ability and motivation was conducted on a group of test users 

using  the  VS  test  platform  with  the  PTA  (Lim,  Ailiya,  Miao,  &  Shen,  2014).  An  informal 

interview was conducted over the advantages of PTA compared to the traditional teachable 

agent. The test users had indicated positive interest in learning with the PTA in the VS test 

platform. The test users have responded that PTA was interactive and they  were willing to 

teach it. The PTA also appeared to be actively interacting with the test users, and provided 

suggestion  that  were  related  to  the  learning  stages  that  they  were  currently  in.  They  had 

also described that the PTA as âa friend in needâ, therefore they were more likely to teach 

the PTA as the test users had treated the PTA as friendly companion. It was also highlighted 

that  PTA  had  to  continue  to  be  persuasive  even  when  they  were  already  teaching  it.  This 

indicated that the PTA had to continue to be persuasive so as to help the learners reflect on 

the concept that was taught to the PTA.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 15 is a summary of the interview and some of the suggestions that was brought 

up during the interview. 

Table 15 Summary of Interview 

Advantages of PTA 

Improvements to PTA 

ï·  Responsive especially when avatar is idling 
ï·  Provides appropriate responses at correct 

timing 

ï·  Provides guidance to the activities in the 

Virtual Learning Environment 

ï·  Needs to a wider range of emotions and 

more variety of actions 

ï·  Further integration of the PTA in actual 

teaching phrase.  

The  case  studies  conducted  had  provided  useful  formative  feedback  during  the 

developmental  stage  of the  PTA  leading to  the  improvements  in  VS  saga.  However due  to 

the small sample size of the study group, there was no statistical significance analysis drawn 

from these studies. However, these small group studies provided an iterative analysis of the 

PTA during the design process of the VS saga. 

3.8  Discussion 

In comparison to the existing teachable agent in previous version of VS, the PTA is able to 

response intuitively to suit the studentâs learning requirements. The improved PTA is able to 

respond better to individual needs of the learner based on his or her ability and motivation. 

At the same time the PTA possessed the capability to provide strategies to encourage social 

interaction with the PTA, which will keep learners engaged while teaching the PTA. 

The  improved  PTA  architecture  in  the  VS  saga  bridges  the  gap  between  theoretical 

concepts of the PTA model and the actual implementation of the PTA in a 3D game engine. 

The  following  chapter  is  a  follow-up  of  the  user  study  on  intergenerational  learning  using 

the PTA VS saga, based on the research questions and hypothesis of this thesis.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
4  Persuasive Teachable Agent for 

Intergenerational Learning 

4.1  PTA for Intergenerational Learning 

To our best knowledge, there is no data and studies on the intergenerational learning with 

teachable  agents.  The  question  is  whether  the  PTA,  a  teachable  agent  with  persuasion 

capabilities  can  benefit  intergenerational  learning.  The  study  explored  how  different 

generations would respond to the PTA in the virtual learning environment.  

4.1.1 Assessment of PTA  

To assess the PTA in terms of its usage in intergenerational learning, the design of this study 

is based the phenomenological research.  The phenomenological research method involves 

discovering  a  phenomena  by  gathering  information  through  qualitative  research  methods, 

for example, by interviewing the participants, discussion and observing the participants in a 

situation (Lester, 1999).  

The aim of  phenomenological  research  is to  describe the  phenomenon  in  an  accurate 

manner  at  the  same  time,  refrain  from  any  bias  thus,  staying  with  the  facts  (Groenewald, 

2004). The advantage of the phenomenological method is that it can be applied to a single 

case  or  unforeseen  or  specifically  selected  sample  participants 

(Lester,  1999). 

Phenomenological research method was adopted in this study. 

4.1.2 Methods 

The  purpose  of  this  study 

is  to  evaluate  the  perception  and  experience  of 

intergenerational  learning  within  groups  of  players  interacting  PTA.  The  participants  are 

required  to  teach  the  PTA  steps  to  complete  the  game  with  someone  either  younger  or 

older  than them.  A  control of  paired participants  will  evaluate a  version  of VS  saga  with  a 

teachable agent without persuasion and treatment group will evaluate a version of VS saga 

with the PTA.  

 
 
 
 
In  addition,  there  are  two  types  of  data  collection  in  this  study.  The  type  of  data 

collected which involves the learner playerâs progress in the VS saga and the assessment of 

the  learner  playerâs  performance  in  the  post-game  questionnaire.  The  following  are  the 

details of the data collection procedure.   

4.1.3 Procedure  

Firstly, the participants are briefed on the purpose of the study. Followed by an invitation to 

complete a 20 minutes interactive session where they are required to test the VS saga. After 

which, they are given 15 minutes to complete a post-game questionnaire.  

Once  their  consent  is  granted,  the  participants  are  required  to  fill  up  their  social-

demographic  data  which  consist  of  their  personal  background,  gender,  age  and  highest 

education attained. The participants are thereby required to complete the rest of the post-

game questionnaire. 

4.1.4 Post-game Questionnaire 

The post-game questionnaire with 32 questions is given out to each of the participant. The 

questions in the post-game questionnaire include 5-point likert scale (Strongly disagree = 1, 

disagree  =  2,  neutral  =  3,  agree  =  4,  strongly  disagree  =  5)  questions,  matrix  questions, 

contingency  questions,  closed  and  open-ended  questions.    Section  A  of  the  questionnaire 

consists  of  4  questions  related  to  the  demographics  and  personal  background  of  the 

participants.  

Section  B  of  the  questionnaire  consists  of  8  questions  that  were  related  to  the 

participantâs learning experiences that the participants felt during the PTA. The participants 

were  required  to  rank  these  questions  according  to  a  5-point  likert  scale.  In  this  section, 

questions 5 to 9 are related to the social skills that the participants have experienced or felt 

when  they  are  teaching  the  PTA.  Question  10  relates  to  the  problem  skills  the  participant 

have encountered in the game. Questions 11 and 12 are related to the people skills that the 

participants have felt during the interactive session in VS saga. People skills in this case refer 

to both psychological skills and social skills. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
In Section C, there are three questions numbered 13 to 15. These questions are three 5-

point  likert  scale  questions  that  relate  to  the  participantâs  knowledge,  values  and  role 

respectively.  In  Section  D  are  three  questions  numbered  16  to  18.  These  questions  are 

related to the participantâs attitude and opinion on learning with the PTA.  

In Section E, there are three questions numbered 19 to 21 related to the participantâs 

feelings towards the PTA on a 5-point likert scale rating. Note was taken that question 20 is 

coded  on  a  reserve  scale.  Section  F  from  22  to  24  are  three  questions  on  a  5-point  likert 

scale  related  to  the  participantâs  perceptions  towards  the  PTA.  Section  G  is  an  open-end 

question  that  requires  the  participants  to  fill  in  suggestions  on  improving  the  PTA  to 

enhance their learning experience.  

In the Section H of the questionnaire there are four questions, numbered 26 to 29 that 

relate to the participantâs general intergenerational relationship background. Question 26 is 

related  to  the  participantâs  level  of  interest  to  spend  their  leisure  time  learning  with 

someone older or younger than them, rated on a 5-point likert scale. Question 27 is a matrix 

of factors that affect the participantâs decision to spend time in intergenerational learning 

activities.  Question  28  is  a  close-ended  question  that  relates  to  the  kind  of  activities  that 

interest  the  participant  in  intergenerational  learning.  Question  29  is  an  open-ended 

question that probes on what will motivate the participants to intergenerational learning.   

Section I consists of three questions numbered from 30 to 32. Question 30 and 31 are 

contingency questions. Question 30, relates to how the participants feel about using virtual 

learning environments such as VS saga to promote intergenerational learning. Question  31 

relates to whether the PTA is able to aid intergenerational learning.  

The  last  Section  J  concludes  the  questionnaire  with  an  open-ended  question  that 

probes on the any additional comments that relates to the VS saga system or the study. The 

following section is a further breakdown of the categories in the data collected.  

4.2  Data Collection  

The average age of the sample (M=??, SD = ??) of a total of N = ?? that participated in the 

study. Below is the detailed breakdown of the data that are collected from the control and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment group of participants in the post-game questionnaire. And the description of the 

in-game progress data which include the PTA performance, the analysis of the participantâs 

mouse clicks and time spent in the VS saga. 

4.2.1 Learning Experiences with PTA  

In this section of the questionnaire, participants are asked to rate their learning experiences 

in the VS saga, according to the skills sets that are likely to gain during the test session. 

Social Skills 

The  participants  are  required  to  rate  5  questions  numbered  from  questions  5  to  9  in  the 

post-game questionnaire in terms of the social skills and learning experiences based on a 5-

point  likert  scale    (Strongly  disagree  =  1,  disagree  =  2,  neutral  =  3,  agree  =  4,  strongly 

disagree = 5) that participants gained in the session.  

Question 5 relates to whether the participants have active listening skills that they have 

gained by taking up the advice from the PTA. Question 6 relates to whether the participants 

have  taken  responsibility  to  PTAâs  learning  process.  Question  7  probes  on  whether  the 

participants felt encouraged by the PTA. Question 8 and 9 relate to whether the participants 

were able to focus and staying on the task assigned to them in the quests and missions that 

they have to complete in the VS despite the distracters that are placed in the game.  

Problem Solving Skills 

In question 10 of the post-game questionnaire, the participants are asked whether they are 

able to solve the problems that they had encountered in the VS saga.  

People Skills 

Questions 11 and 12 of relate to the people skills learning experience that the participants 

have gained during the session. Question 11 relates to whether the participants have learnt 

trust  and  respect  and  question  12  relates  to  whether  the  participants  have  gained 

understanding and whether the participants have empathized with the teachable agent.  

 
 
 
 
4.2.2 Knowledge, Values and Role in Virtual Learning 

Questions 13 to 15 relate to the knowledge, values and roles the participants experience in 

virtual learning. Question 13 explores whether they had learnt new knowledge other than 

information on the science concepts such as osmosis and diffusion.  Question 14 relates to 

values that the participants gain during the session.  

Opinion on Learning with the PTA 

The  opinion  on  learning  with  PTA  section  consists  of  three  questions,  numbered  16  to18. 

These  questions  are  focused  on  the  participantâs  attitudes  towards  interaction  with  their 

teammate and the PTA during the test session.  

Question 16 relates to the whether the participants have engaged in learning during the 

session.  Question  17  probes  on  whether  the  participants  are  motivated  to  find  out  more 

information  on  the  science  topics  during  the  session.    Question  18  asks  the  participants 

whether the participants felt that they have learnt more when teaching with the PTA with 

their teammate.  

Feelings towards the PTA 

In  this  section, there  are  three questions that  investigate  the participantâs  feeling  towards 

the PTA. Question 19 probes on whether the participants  have felt confident that the PTA 

will be able to do well. Question 20 asks whether the participants  have felt nervous when 

they are interacting with PTA. Question 21 relates to whether the participants have felt any 

strong emotional feelings towards the PTA during the session.   

Perceptions towards the PTA 

The questions that probe on the participantâs perception towards the PTA consist of three 

questions from 22 to 24.  

Question 22 probes on whether the participants felt responsible for the PTA. Question 

23  relates  to  whether  the  PTA  responded  as  the  participants  have  expected.  Question  24 

asks  if  the  participants  are  satisfied  with  PTA  performance  on  the  concept  map.  Fig.40 

shows the ratings in perceptions towards PTA. 

 
 
 
 
 
4.2.3 In-game Progress  

PTA Performance  

A  key  indicator  on  how  well  the  learner  player  has  engaged  in  learning  is  the  PTAâs 

performance. In order to analyse this aspect in learning, the PTA learning results are tracked 

according  to  the  number  of  attempts  the  learner  player  tries  to  teach  the  PTA.  The 

knowledge that PTA have learnt from the learn player will also provide insights to how well 

that learner player has responded to the interaction with the PTA in the VS saga VLE.  

Mouse Clicks 

In addition to the post-game questionnaire and the events tracked by the PTA, the learner 

userâs  mouse  clicks  are  recorded.  This  provides  greater  insight  on  the  activities  and  richer 

information on what the learner user are doing in the VS saga system. The information will 

allow future developers of the VS saga to improve the interface design as well as aid in the 

evaluation and analysis of the effectiveness of the PTA in the system.  

Time Spent  

Another important factor that determines the learner playerâs activities in the VS saga is the 

time that they spent on each task assigned to them. Therefore, the time between each task 

to complete will be tracked.

5  Conclusion and Future Work 

5.1  Summary of Contributions 

Contribution 1: PTA Model 

The  first  contribution  is  the  formalization  of  the  definition  for  the  Persuasive  Teachable 

Agent (PTA) model. The PTA model is a goal-oriented modelling approach that deliberates 

the  teachable  agentâs  goal  to  select  persuasion  to  influence  userâs  decision  to  teach  the 

teachable agent.  

Contribution 2: Persuasive Reasoning Model 

The  persuasive  reasoning  model  is  designed  to  assist  the  PTA  in  reasoning  the  methods 

persuade the user into teach the teachable agent. The persuasive reasoning is based on the 

Elaboration  Likelihood  Model  (ELM)  (Cacioppo  &  Petty,  1984)  of  persuasion.  The  ELM  is  a 

well-established  theory  of  persuasion  describes  the  process  in  which  attitudes  can  be 

formed and altered. The ELM persuasion theory is the theoretical foundation of persuasion 

in the persuasive reasoning in the PTA. 

To realize the persuasive reasoning in the PTA the Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) is applied 

to the persuasive FCM computational model to compute the motivation and ability for the 

PTA  to  reason  its  persuasive  actions.  This  allows  the  PTA  to  select  appropriate  actions  to 

influence the userâs decisions to teach the teachable agent. 

Contribution 3: PTA for Intergenerational Learning 

The PTA has been implemented to the VS Saga virtual learning environment.  An improved 

PTA  model  that  bridges  the  gap  between  persuasion  theory  and  implementation  as  an 

intelligent  teachable  agent  is  attained.  A  formal  case  study  on  the  effects  of  PTA  on 

intergenerational learning has also been conducted.  

 
 
 
 
5.2  Future Work 

The research questions and hypotheses have highlighted the research direction of the PTA. 

The future works in this section is directed towards the implementation and evaluation of 

the PTA which also covers the potential of PTA research in future projects. The following are 

some of the possible extensive applications of PTA. 

5.2.1 Persuasive Teachable Agent in Citizen Science Projects  

The Persuasive teachable agent (PTA) is beneficial for learners in terms of improvements in 

learning  experience.  The  PTA  also  encourages  learners  from  different  age  groups  to 

participate in learning activities. There are opportunities to look into areas of interest where 

learners will be interested in participating in group learning activities that are beneficial in 

terms of building relations across different age groups. Intergenerational learning activities 

create the opportunity for PTA to be applied in informal science educational projects on a 

large scale basis, such as a âcitizen scienceâ projects.  

Citizen science projects are initiatives where volunteers and enthusiasts from different 

backgrounds  participate  in  scientific  research,  allowing  the  data  collected  to  be  made 

available for analysis on a larger scale (Duke, 2012).  A citizen scientist communicates with 

the general public who engage the public outreach of scientific information (Clark & Illman, 

2001;  Duke  &  Emma,  2012).  The  participants  in  citizen  science  projects  are  citizen 

volunteers who take on the active role of data collection and analysis (Duke & Emma, 2012).  

There  are  advantages  in  adopting  citizen  science  in  engaging  the  public  in  science 

research,  especially  in  capitalizing  the  human  resources  available  in  solving  scientific 

problems  at  the  same  time  and  increases  the  resources  available  and  reduce  the  cost 

involved on conducting large scale by outreaching to a large number of users (Duke, 2012).  

One  example  of  a  citizen  science  project  is  The  Bird  House  Network  (TBN)  by  Cornell 

Laboratory of ornithology where participants reports on observations of nest boxes setup in 

their neighbourhood allow for data monitoring of knowledge to be reported and collected 

through various  media such as email, interaction by TBN staff through phone calls (Brossard, 

Lewenstein, & Bonney, 2005).  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Other  projects  adopt  an  online  approach,  for  example,  the  Foldit  online  game  allows 

players  to  collaborate,  and  develop  strategies  to  accumulate  game  points  in  different 

playing levels by folding proteins, (Hand, 2010). The Foldit project has benefited participants 

in allowing them to solve real life scientific problems. The participants in the Foldit project 

also  experience  the  process  of  research  as  well  as  joy  in  finding  a  social  community  with 

similar  interest.  The emergence  of ubiquitous  technologies  allows  for  collection  of  data to 

be collected on the go, mobile devices sensing enables researchers a wider form of data to 

be  collected  through  logging  and  cataloguing  measurements  in  everyday  environments 

(Paulos, 2009).  

Despite the apparent advantages there are issues in citizen science projects such as the 

management  of  citizen  science  projects  which  requires  identifying  the  motivation  for 

participation. The quality of the data collected and the effects of citizen science projects on 

participants (Duke & Emma, 2012).  There is research potential in the investigation dynamics 

of the information exchange between human and agents during citizen science projects.   

Figure 40 PTA Knowledge base increases with the user inputs. 

Future research directions can also be expanded into exploring the types of information 

that  are  exchanged  during  the  interaction  with  persuasive  teachable  agent  in  driving 

 
 
 
 
 
participants  to  contribute  to  citizen  science  and  examine  the  potential  and  issues  of 

applying PTA in intergenerational learning through citizen science projects. For example, in 

citizen science projects, the PTA acts as central knowledge base collecting activity logs and 

learning  knowledge  from  users  from  different  age  group,  at  the  same  time  analyses  the 

information  using  Goal-Oriented  Fuzzy  Cognitive  Persuasive  Reasoning  to  encourage  the 

learning  from  one  another.  A  representation  of  the  âripple  effectâ  from  the  exchange  in 

information  is  shown  in  Fig.  40  where  the  growth  of  knowledge  gained  from  the  PTA 

affecting the different users. 

5.2.2 Persuasive Gerontechnology  

With the global trend gearing towards an aging population, there are various challenges and 

issues  that  arise  with  old  age.  Technologies  are  often  sought  after  to  solve  problems 

associate  with  old  age  such  as  the  deterioration  in  physical  and  cognitive  abilities. 

Gerontechnology  is  an  area  of  study  in  which  technologies  are  used  to  benefit  the  well-

being of the aging population (J.L. Fozard, 2005).  

Persuasive  technology  on  the  other  hand  involves  the  use  of  technology  to  alter 

attitudes and behaviour without coercion (Fogg, 1999). Persuasive technology can play the 

part  of  influencing  positive  behaviours  and  attitude  among  the  aged  and  aging  person  to 

enhance  quality  of  life.  However,  most  of  the  research  in  persuasive  technologies  are 

targeted at the younger generation, teens and preteens, and trending towards influencing 

the  attitudes  and  behaviours  of  adults  (King  &  Tester,  1999).  Persuasive  gerontechnology 

therefore  looks  at  the  area  in  which  technology  can  provide  positive  influence  towards 

attitude and behaviours to meet the ambitions, activities and wisdom of the aging society 

(James L Fozard & Kearns, 2006).  

The PTA is a persuasive technology that can be used to enhance the life of the elderly, 

for example the PTA can lessen the perceived difficulty in learning a technology as the older 

person  often  perceive  that  mastering  a  new  technology  takes  significant  cognitive  effort. 

Another form of PTA can be applied to the prevention and management of diseases where 

PTA  can  be  used  to  encourage  the  elderly  to  adopt  healthy 

lifestyle,  through 

intergenerational  learning  activities.  The  PTA  acts  as  a  form  persuasive  gerontechnology, 

 
 
 
 
 
will  encourage  the  elderly  to  lead  a  more  active  life  that  involve  life-  long  learning  and 

encourage intergeneration bonding. 

5.2.3 User Modelling in Persuasive Teachable Agents 

User  modelling  in  human  computer  interaction,  allow  for  systems  to  understand  users  in 

order  to  build  systems  that  suit  individual  userâs  need  (Fischer,  2001).  Learners  from 

different  backgrounds  possess  different  skills  and  personal  reasons  to  engage  in  learning 

with  teachable  agents.  Thus,  understanding  learnerâs  ability  and  motivation  becomes 

important in building adaptive systems to cater to different learners. The approach to user 

modelling  in  PTA  utilizes  the  combination  of  persuasion  theory  and  machine  learning  to 

generate usersâ learning behaviour and cognitive processes (Webb, Pazzani, & Billsus, 2001).  

The future work in PTA will include the tracking of  student learner learning activity data 

collected  from  the  learning  environment  based  on  the  persuasion  theory  such  as 

Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to evaluate the level of learning ability and motivation 

based on their receptiveness to either central or peripheral route of persuasion (Cacioppo & 

Petty,  1984).    As  well  as  analysing  the  learning  activity  data  to  model  userâs  response  to 

model persuasive strategies that cater to individual learners. 

5.2.4 Feedback with Question Answering (QA) engine 

Studies  have  shown  that  feedback  support  in  teachable  agent  helped  student  learners  to 

learn  better,  especially  when  they  receive  self-regulated  learner  feedback  from  their 

teachable agents (Tan & Biswas, 2006). For example, teachable agents who are able to ask 

questions  and probe  the  student  tutor  encourage  reflection  and help the  student  tutor to 

structure  their  knowledge  (Roscoe  et  al.,  2008).  Directed,  corrective  immediate  feedback 

has  also  shown  to  aid  in  immediate  learning.  While  guided  and  metacognitive  feedback 

which  comes  in  a  form of  reaffirming   the  knowledge  that the  student  tutors have  taught 

the  teachable  agent  helps  the  tutors  to  monitor  the  teachable  agent  learning  progress  as 

well as assess the tutors own learning (Biswas & Leeawong, 2005).  The body of research has 

shown the importance of teachable agent feedback to the student tutors.  

 
 
 
 
The questioning and answering (QA) in the field of information retrieval for computer 

systems to search for short phrases or sentences, provides precise answers to userâs query 

in large textual database (Prager, Chu-Carroll, Brown, & Czuba, 2006). QA systems allow for 

users  to  ask  questions  in  natural  language  that  they  use  in  their  daily  lives  and  they  can 

receive answers quickly (Hirschman & Gaizauskas, 2001).   

 The PTA aims to provide appropriate feedback to the student tutors with QA engine to 

provide  learners  with  the  information  from  the  PTA  knowledge  base  so  as  to  keep  them 

motivated in learning. The goal of the PTA feedback is to encourage student tutors to stay 

focus  on  learning  tasks  with  the  PTA.  And  future  work  can  be  aimed  towards  providing 

persuasive  feedback  using  QA engine  and  observing  the effects  of  persuasive  feedback  on 

learner from different age groups.  

5.2.5 Evaluating and Assessing Persuasive Teachable Agents  

The  effects  of  persuasion  on  changing  learning  attitude  with  teachable  agent  have  been 

positive  in  the  preliminary  experiment  Future  studies  can  be  extended  to  include  a  wider 

range  of  effects  on  learners  such  as  behaviour,  cognition  and  emotional  changes  during 

interaction with PTA. The studies can also include a larger sample size of participants. 

Further  experiments  can  be  conducted  to  evaluate  favourable  and  unfavourable 

attitude  change  in  learners  and  addressing  the  unfavourable  attitude  change,  which  is 

outside the area of the existing ELM persuasion model.

Information and Consent 

Thank  you  for  taking  the  time  to  participate  in  this  research  study  involving  the  use  of  a  virtual 
environment to teach lower secondary science. The purpose of this study is to collect information on 
your opinion of intergenerational learning with a novel artificial intelligent agent which implements 
persuasion  in  order  to  stimulate  interest.  The  results  of  this  study  will  be  used  in  the  writing  of  a 
thesis  for  the  fulfillment  of  the  requirement  for  a  degree  of  doctor  in  philosophy  in  computer 
engineering.  

As a participant, you will be asked to test two versions of an interactive virtual learning environment 
titled âVirtual Singapuraâ with a teammate. Following this you will need to answer a short written 
questionnaire.  Participation  will  take  approximately  20  minutes  for  the  interactive  session  and  15 
minutes for the survey questionnaire.  

There are no known or anticipated risks associated with the participation in this study. 

Confidentially  

Data collected  during  this study  is  intended to  be  used  solely  for  research  purpose.  Access  to  this 
data will be restricted to only the main investigator of the research thesis and its reviewers. 

All information you provide is considered confidential; your name will not be included or in any way 
associated with the data collected in the study. Furthermore, our interest is in the average responses 
of the entire group of participants rather than the individual. You will not be identified individually in 
any way in written reports of this research, and will instead be referred to by a number within the 
report (e.g. Participant 1). The results of this study will also be made available to participants upon 
request. 

Voluntary Participation 

Participation  in  this  study  is  voluntary.  If  you  wish,  you  may  decline  to  answer  any  questions  or 
participate in any component of the study. You may also decide to withdraw from this study at any 
time and may do so without any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.
