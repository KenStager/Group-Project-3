Abstract

This paper applies the principles of continuum mechanics to safely and resiliently coordinate a multi-agent team. A hybrid
automation with two operation modes, Homogeneous Deformation Mode (HDM) and Containment Exclusion Mode (CEM),
are developed to robustly manage group coordination in the presence of unpredicted agent failures. HDM becomes active
when all agents are healthy, where the group coordination is deï¬ned by homogeneous transformation coordination functions.
By classifying agents as leaders and followers, a desired n-D homogeneous transformation is uniquely related to the desired
trajectories of n + 1 leaders and acquired by the remaining followers in real-time through local communication. The paper oï¬ers
a novel approach for leader selection as well as naturally establishing and reestablishing inter-agent communication whenever
the agent team enters the HDM. CEM is activated when at least one agent fails to admit group coordination. This paper
applies unique features of decentralized homogeneous transformation coordination to quickly detect each arising anomalous
situation and excludes failed agent(s) from group coordination of healthy agents. In CEM, agent coordination is treated as an
ideal ï¬uid ï¬ow where the desired agentsâ paths are deï¬ned along stream lines inspired by ï¬uid ï¬ow ï¬eld theory to circumvent
exclusion spaces surrounding failed agent(s).

Key words: Resilient Multi-agent Coordination, Physics-based Methods, Local Communication, Continuum Deformation,
and Decentralized Control.

1 Introduction

Control of multi-agent systems has been widely inves-
tigated over the past two decades. Formation and co-
operative control can reduce cost and improve the ro-
bustness and capability of reconï¬guration in a coopera-
tive mission. Therefore, researchers have been motivated
to explore diverse applications for the multi-agent coor-
dination such as formation control [32], traï¬c conges-
tion control [30], distributed sensing, [12], cooperative
surveillance [31], and cooperative payload transport [18].

1.1 Related Work

Centralized and decentralized cooperative control ap-
proaches have been previously proposed for multi-agent
coordination. The virtual structure [25] [24] model treats
agents as particles of a rigid body. Assuming the virtual
body has an arbitrary translation and rigid body rota-
tion in a 3-D motion space, the desired trajectory of ev-

ery agent is determined in a centralized fashion. Consen-
sus [5] [14] [7] [3] [19] [1] [36] [15] [28] [34] and contain-
ment control are the most common decentralized coordi-
nation approaches. Multi-agent coordination using ï¬rst-
order consensus [16] and second-order consensus [5] [14]
has been extensively investigated by researchers in the
past. Leader-based and leaderless consensus have been
studied in Refs. [7] and [3]. Stability of the retarded
consensus method was studies in Refs. [19] [1]. Finite-
time multi-agent consensus of continuous time systems
is studied in Refs. [36] [15]. Refs. [28] [34] evaluate con-
sensus under a switching communication topology in the
presence of disturbances.

More recently, researchers have investigated the resilient
consensus problem and provided guarantee conditions
for reaching consensus in the presence of malicious
agents [4, 9, 10, 26]. Weighted Mean Subsequence Re-
duced (W-MSR) is commonly used to detect an adver-
sary and remove malicious agent(s) from the communi-
cation network of normal agents [4,10]. r-robustness and
(r, s)-robustness conditions are used to prove network
resilience under consensus. Particularly, ( f + 1, f + 1)-
robustness is considered as the necessary and suï¬cient
condition for resilience of the consensus protocol in the

Containment control is a decentralized leader-follower
approach in which multi-agent coordination is guided
by a ï¬nite number of leaders and acquired by followers
through local communication. Necessary and suï¬cient
conditions for the stability of continuum deformation co-
ordination have been provided in Refs. [17]. Ref. [6] stud-
ies the convergence of containment control and demon-
strates that followers ultimately converge to the convex
hull deï¬ned by leaders. Containment control under ï¬xed
and switching communication protocols are studied in
Refs. [2] and [11], respectively. Refs. [29,35] study ï¬nite-
time containment stability and convergence. Contain-
ment control stability in the presence of communication
delay is studied in Refs. [27, 33].

Continuum deformation for large-scale coordination
of multi-agent systems is developed in [20]. Similar
to containment control, continuum deformation is a
leader-follower approach in which a group coordination
is guided by a ï¬nite number of leaders and acquired
by followers through local communication [22]. Because
continuum deformation deï¬nes a non-singular mapping
between reference and current agent conï¬gurations at
any time t, follower communication weights are con-
sistent with leader agentsâ reference positions in the
continuum deformation coordination. The continuum
deformation method advances containment control by
formal characterization of safety in a large-scale coordi-
nation. Assuming continuum deformation is given by a
homogeneous transformation, inter-agent collision and
agent follower containment are guaranteed in a con-
tinuum deformation coordination by assigning a lower
limit on the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the
homogeneous transformation. Therefore, a large num-
ber of agents participating in a continuum deformation
coordination can safely and aggressively deform to pass
through narrow passages in a cluttered environment.

1.2 Contributions and Outline

This paper proposes a physics-inspired approach to the
resilient multi-agent coordination problem. In particu-
lar, multi-agent coordination is modeled by a hybrid au-
tomation with two physics-based coordination modes: (i)
Homogeneous Deformation Mode (HDM) and (ii) Con-
tainment Exclusion Mode (CEM).

HDM is active when all agents are healthy and can ad-
mit the desired coordination deï¬ned by a homogeneous
deformation. In the HDM, agents are treated as parti-
cles of an n-D deformable body and the desired coordi-
nation, deï¬ned based on the trajectories of n + 1 leaders
forming an n-D simplex at any time t, is acquired by the
followers through local communication. 1 .

1 This paper considers agents as particles of 2-D and 3-D

CEM is activated once an adversarial situation is de-
tected due to unpredicted vehicle or agent failure. The
paper oï¬ers a novel approach for rapid detection of each
anomalous or failed agent and excludes it from group
coordination with the healthy vehicles. In CEM the de-
sired coordination is treated as an irrotational ï¬uid ï¬ow
and adversarial agents are excluded from the safe plan-
ning space by combining ideal ï¬uid ï¬ow patterns in a
computationally-eï¬cient manner.

Compared to the existing literature and the authorsâ pre-
vious work, this paper oï¬ers the following contributions:

(1) The paper oï¬ers a novel distributed approach for
detection of anomalous situations in which unex-
pected vehicle failure(s) disrupt collective vehicle
motion.

(2) This paper advances the existing continuum defor-
mation coordination theory by relaxing the follower
containment constraint and oï¬ering a tetrahedral-
ization approach to assign followersâ communica-
tion weights in an unsupervised fashion.

(3) The paper proposes a model-free guarantee condi-
tion for convergence and inter-agent collision avoid-
ance in a large-scale homogeneous transformation.
(4) Compared to existing resilient coordination work
[9] [26] [4] [10], this paper oï¬ers a computationally-
eï¬cient safety recovery method. At CEM, every
agent assigns its own desired trajectory without
communication with other agents only by knowing
the geometry of the unsafe domains enclosing the
anomalous agents, as well as its own reference po-
sition when the CEM is activated.

(5) This paper proposes a tetrahedralization method to
(i) naturally establish/reestablish inter-agent com-
munication links and weights, (ii) classify agents as
boundary and follower agents, (iii) determine lead-
ers in an unsupervised fashion.

(6) The authors believe this is the ï¬rst paper describing
safe exclusion of a failed agent in a cooperative team
with inspiration from ï¬uid ï¬ow models.

This paper is organized as follows. Preliminaries in Sec-
tion 2 are followed by a resilient continuum deformation
formulation in Section 3. Physics-based models for the
HDM and CEM are described in Section 4. Operation
of the resilient continuum deformation coordination is

2.1 Position Notations

The following position notations are used throughout
this paper: Reference position of vehicle i is denoted
by ri,0 = (cid:2)xi,0 yi,0 zi,0
(cid:3)T . In this paper, a reference
conï¬guration is deï¬ned based on agentsâ current po-
sitions once they enter the HDM. Actual position of
vehicle i is denoted ri(t) = [xi(t) yi(t) zi(t)]T at time
t. Local desired position of vehicle i
is denoted by
ri,d(t) = [xi,d(t) yi,d(t) zi,d(t)]T at time t. ri,d is up-
dated through local communication and deï¬ned based
on actual positions of the in-neighbor vehicles of agent
i. Global desired position of vehicle i
is denoted by
ri,c(t) = [xi,c(t) yi,c(t) zi,c(t)]T at time t. The transient
error is deï¬ned as the diï¬erence between actual position
ri(t) and global desired position ri,c(t) for vehicle i at
any time t.

2.2 Motion Space Tetrahedralization and Î Operator

Assume c â R3Ã1; p1, p2, Â· Â· Â· , pn+1 â R3Ã1 are n + 1
arbitrary position vectors in a 3-D motion space. Then,
rank operator (cid:60)n is deï¬ned as follows:

n = 2, 3,

(cid:60)n (p1, Â· Â· Â· , pn) = rank

(cid:16) (cid:104)

p2 â p1 Â· Â· Â· pn+1 â p1

If p1, Â· Â· Â· , pn+1 are positioned at the vertices an n-D
simplex, then (cid:60)n (p1, Â· Â· Â· , pn) = n. p1, p2, p3, and p4 form
a tetrahedron for n = 3, if (cid:60)3 (p1, p2, p3, p4) = 3. p1, p2,
and p3 form a triangle for n = 2, if (cid:60)2 (p1, p2, p3) = 2.

For n = 3, p1, p2, p3, p4, and c represent real points

Therefore, p3

(4), is perpendicular to the triangular plane made by
agents p1, p2, and p3 (see Fig. 1). Consequently, virtual
agent p2
4 and in-neighbor agent p1, p2, and p3 form a
tetrahedron. The projection of c on the triangular plane
made by p1, p2, and p3 is denoted by Ëc2 and expressed
as follows:

3 Problem Formulation and Statement

Consider a 3-D motion space containing M agents where
every agent is uniquely identiï¬ed by a number i â M =
{1, Â· Â· Â· , M }. It is assumed that N(t) (out of M) agents are
enclosed by a rigid-size containment domain

â¦con = â¦con(r, rcon(t)) â R3,

(13)

ri,c(t) = Q(t)ri,0 + d(t),

(8)

at time t. Let rcon(t) â R3Ã1 be the nominal position of
the containment domain given by

where Q(t) is the Jacobian matrix, d(t) is the rigid-body
displacement vector, ri,0 is the reference position of agent
i â VH (t), and VH (t) deï¬nes index numbers of healthy
agents at time t.

VH = VL

where VL = {i1, Â· Â· Â· , in+1} and VF (t) = {in+2, Â· Â· Â· , iNF }
are disjoint sets deï¬ning leaders and followers at time
t. Let ri1,0, Â· Â· Â· , rin+1,0 denote the reference positions of
the leaders and ri j,0 denotes the reference position of
follower ij â V, where reference positions are all assigned
at the time agents ï¬rst enter HDM. Then, we can deï¬ne
Î± parameters Î±i j,i1 through Î±i j,i4 as follows:

Note that 0 â¤ Î²i < 1 is a scaling factor, (cid:205)N (t)

the size of â¦con = â¦con(r, rcon(t)) â R3 does not change

(15)

Agents enclosed by the containment region â¦con(r, rcon(t))
can be classiï¬ed as healthy or anomalous agents, where
healthy agents admit the group desired coordination
while anomalous agents do not. Healthy and anoma-
lous vehicles are deï¬ned by disjoint sets VH and VA,
respectively, where V can be expressed as

V = VH

where VH = (cid:8)i1, Â· Â· Â· , iNF

(cid:9) and VA = {iNF +1, Â· Â· Â· , iN }.

given by

ation mode. rj,c(t) = [xj,c(t) yj,c(t) zj,c(t)]T is the global

tion. Furthermore,

R3Ã1 through hj,m,Î³(xj,c, yj,c, zj,c) â R3Ã1 are the shape
functions.

HDM (Î³ = HDM) is active when VA = â. Therefore,
NF (t) = N(t) agents deï¬ned by set VH are all healthy.
The HDM shape matrix Hj,HDM is time-invariant (con-
stant), where j â VH . The HDM generalized coordinate
vector qHDM â R3(n+1)Ã1 speciï¬es desired velocity com-
ponents of all leaders guiding the group continuum defor-
mation coordination. This paper develops a decentral-
ized leader-follower approach using the tetrahdralization
presented in Section 2.2. By classifying agents as lead-
(cid:208) VF (See Eq. (9)). Lead-
ers and followers, VH = VL
ers, deï¬ned by VL = {i1, Â· Â· Â· , in+1}, move independently.
Followers, deï¬ned by VF = {in+2, Â· Â· Â· , iN }, acquire the
desired coordination through local communication with
leaders and other followers. The paper oï¬ers a tetrahe-
dralization method to determine leaders and followers
and deï¬ne inter-agent communication among vehicles in
an unsupervised fashion for an arbitrary reference con-
ï¬guration of agents.

CEM (Î³ = CEM) is activated once at least one anoma-
lous agent is detected in which case VA (cid:44) â. The CEM
shape matrix Hj,CEM ( j â VH ) is spatially varying. In
particular, the desired vehicle coordination of healthy
vehicle j â VH is deï¬ned by an ideal ï¬uid ï¬ow. For
CEM, it is desired that (i) vehicle j â VH moves along
(cid:0)xj,c, yj,c, t(cid:1) and (ii) x and y compo-
the surface zj,c = zj
nents of the agent coordination are deï¬ned by an irrota-
tional ï¬ow. Mathematically speaking, we deï¬ne coordi-
nate transformation

Notice that stream and potential functions satisfy the
Cauchy-Riemann condition. Therefore, the level curves
Ï(x, y, t) = constant and Ï(x, y, t) = constant are per-
pendicular at the intersection point. This paper deï¬nes
Ï(x, y, t) and Ï(x, y, t) by combining ideal ï¬uid ï¬ow pat-
terns so that an obstacle-free motion space is excluded
from adversaries. This combination can split the x â y
plane into a safe region deï¬ned by set S and unsafe re-
gion deï¬ned by set U. A one-to-one mapping exists be-
tween (xj, yj) and (Ï(xj, yj), Ï(xj, yj)) at every point in
the safe set S. Thus, the Jacobian matrix

by combining âUniformâ and âDoubletâ ï¬ow patterns.
As a result, a single failed vehicle can be separated by a
cylinder from the safe region S in the motion space.

This paper also oï¬ers a novel distributed anomaly detec-
tion approach by using the properties of leader-follower
homogeneous transformation coordination. Particularly,
the Î operator is used to characterize agent deviation of
agents from the desired coordination to quickly identify
failed agent(s) that are not admitting the desired con-
tinuum deformation.

4 Physics-based Modeling of HDM and CEM

HDM and CEM are mathematically modeled in this sec-
tion. A decentralized leader follower method for HDM is
developed in Section 4.1 to acquire a desired continuum
deformation in an unsupervised fashion. CEM coordina-
tion is modeled in Section 4.2.

4.1 Homogeneous Deformation Mode (HDM)

In HDM, vehicles are healthy and cooperative. There-
fore, |VA| = 0 (NF = N and VH = V). Set VH can be

expressed as VH = VL
and VF = {in+2, Â· Â· Â· , iN } deï¬ne leaders and followers, re-

For smooth âï¬owâ every agent j â VH slides along the
Ï (cid:0)xj,c, yj,c, t(cid:1) =
j-th streamline deï¬ned by j â VH,
Ïj,0 = constant at any time t. This condition requires
that the desired trajectory of vehicle j â VH satisfy the

agentsâ reference positions.

4.1.2 Unsupervised Acquisition of a Homogeneous De-

formation Using Tetrahedralization

A desired homogeneous deformation, deï¬ned by n + 1
leaders in an n-D homogeneous deformation, is acquired
by followers through local communication. Communica-
tion among healthy agents is deï¬ned by coordination
graph Gc (V, E) with nodes V (V = VH ) and edges
E â V Ã V. In-neighbor agents of agent i â V are de-
ï¬ned by

(cid:12)( j, i) â E}.

Ni = { j(cid:12)
Assuming the reference formation of agents is known,
n + 1 boundary agents are selected as leaders. Further-
more, every follower i â VF communicates with n + 1 in-
neighbor agents where the in-neighbor agents are placed
at the vertices of an n-simplex containing follower i.

i â V,

Figure 2. Example reference formation used for collective
motion simulation. A red arrow shows a unidirectional link
to a follower from its in-neighbor agent. Blue arrows show
bidirectional communication.

4.1.3 Classiï¬cation of Agents as Leaders and Followers

(cid:208) VI
The node set V can be expressed as V = VB
where VB = {i1, Â· Â· Â· , imB } and VI = {imB +1, Â· Â· Â· , iN } de-
ï¬ne boundary and interior agents, respectively. Given
agentsâ reference positions, the following true statements
are used to assign agent i â V either as a leader or a
follower:

(1) An n-D homogeneous deformation is deï¬ned by n+1
leaders [20, 21]. Assuming leaders are selected from
the boundary agents, VL â VB.

(2) Non-leader boundary agents are the followers spec-

iï¬ed by (VB \ VL) â VF .

(cid:16)

j4,0 and rn

rj1,0, rj2,0, rj3,0, rn

(3) All interior agents are followers, thus, VI â VF .
(4) Agent i is an interior agent and classiï¬ed as a fol-
lower, if there exists a set of three agents j1 j2,
and jn+1 such that Î
> 0,
where rn
i,0 are assigned by Eq. (11) when
subscripts i1, i2, i3, i4, and ij are substituted by j1,
j2, j3, j4, and i, respectively [23].
j4,0, rn

has at least
one negative entry for every j1, Â· Â· Â· , jn+1 â V form-
ing an n-D simplex, where j1 (cid:44) i, Â· Â· Â· , and jn+1 (cid:44) i.
Then, i â V is a boundary agent [23].

i,0

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(6) If i â V is not a follower agent, it is a boundary

agent.

(7) Any n + 1 boundary agents j1, Â· Â· Â· , jn+1 can be se-
lected as leaders. The remaining boundary agents
are also considered as the followers.

To better clarify the above statements, the reference
formation shown in Fig. 2 is considered. The vehicle
team consists of 22 agents (V = {1, Â· Â· Â· , 22}). Set VB =
{i1, Â· Â· Â· , i10} deï¬ne the boundary agents, where i1 = 1,
i2 = 2, i3 = 3, i4 = 10, i5 = 12, i6 = 14, i7 = 18, i8 = 20,
i9 = 21, i10 = 22. While VL = {i1, i2, i3} speciï¬es the lead-
ers, VB â VL deï¬nes the boundary followers. Boundary
followers all communicate with leaders 1, 2, and 3. Note
that links from leaders i1, i2, and i3 to boundary followers
are not shown in Fig. 2. Additionally, VI = {i11, Â· Â· Â· , i22}
deï¬nes interior agents, where i11 = 4, i12 = 5, i13 = 6,
i14 = 7, i15 = 8, i16 = 9, i17 = 11, i18 = 13, i19 = 15,
i20 = 16, i21 = 17, and i22 = 19 are the interior vehicles.
Note that VI â VF are all followers.

4.1.4 Followersâ In-Neighbors, Communication Weights,

(28)

Note that global and local desired positions of leader
agent j â VL are the same at any time t. The component
Âµ â {x, y, z} of the local desired positions of followers
satisfy the following relation:

In-neighbors of an interior follower h â VI is deï¬ned by

In other words, the n + 1 closest agents belonging to set
Fh are considered as the in-neighbors of follower h â VF .

Every boundary follower agent j â VB \ VL commu-
nicates with n+1 leaders deï¬ned by VL. Therefore, Nj =
VL deï¬nes in-neighbor agent of vehicle j â VL â VB.

Followersâ Communication Weights: Each communica-
tion weight wi, jk (k = 1, Â· Â· Â· , n + 1) is speciï¬ed based on

neighbor vehicle jk â Ni = { j1, Â· Â· Â· , jn+1} as follows:

forming row algebraic operations. Entries of the lower
triangle of matrix D can be all converted to 0, if a top
row is multiplied by a negative scalar and the outcome
is added to the other rows. Elements of the upper tri-
angular submatrix of L can be similarly zeroed, if the
bottom row is multiplied by a negative scalar and the
outcome is added to the other rows. Therefore, Dâ1, ob-

deï¬ned at HDM. It is assumed that every vehicle is en-
closed by a vertical cylinder of radius (cid:15), and dmin denotes
the minimum separation distance between every vehi-

collision avoidance is guaranteed in a homogeneous de-

so that collision with obstacles and inter-agent collision
are both avoided while the leadersâ distances between ini-
tial and target states are minimized. Leader path plan-
ning using A* search and particle swarm optimization
were previously studied in Refs. [13, 21]. Control inputs
UL and UF can be assigned using existing approaches
so the actual trajectory rj is asymptotically tracked rj,c
for every vehicle j â V; speciï¬c analysis of tracking is
beyond the scope of this paper.

4.2 Containment Exclusion Mode (CEM)

CEM is activated when there exists at least one vehicle
experiencing a failure or anomaly in containment domain
â¦con. Failed agent(s) are wrapped with an exclusion zone
and healthy agents must be routed or âï¬owâ around.
Thus, NF (t) < N(t) and |VA(t)| > 0 at any time t when
CEM is active. For CEM, the coordinate transformation
deï¬ned in (18) is used to assign the desired agent coor-
dination. In particular, potential function Ï and stream
function Ï are determined by combining âUniformâ and
âDoubletâ ï¬ows:

Ï(x, y, t) =ÏU (x, y, t) + ÏD(x, y, t)
Ï(x, y, t) =ÏU (x, y, t) + ÏD(x, y, t)

where the subscripts U and D are associated with âUni-
formâ and âDoubletâ, respectively. For the uniform ï¬ow
pattern,

ÏU (x, y, t) = uâ(t) (x cos Î¸â(t) + y sin Î¸â(t))

(38a)

ÏU (x, y, t) = uâ(t) (âx sin Î¸â(t) + y cos Î¸â(t)) ,

(38b)

deï¬ne the potential and stream ï¬elds, respectively,
where uâ(t) and Î¸â(t) are design parameters. Further-
more,

ÏD = (cid:213)

ÏD,i

and

ÏD = (cid:213)

ÏD,i,

i âVA

i âVA

deï¬ne potential and stream ï¬elds of the Doublet ï¬ow,
respectively, where

ÏD,i = Î´i(t) [cos Î³i(t) (x â ai(t)) + sin Î³i(t) (y â bi(t))]

,

(x â ai(t))2 + (y â bi(t))2

(x â ai(t))2 + (y â bi(t))2

(39a)
ÏD,i = Î´i(t) [â sin Î³i(t) (x â ai(t)) + cos Î³i(t) (y â bi(t))]
(39b)
and âi, ai, bi are design parameters specifying the ge-
ometry and location of anomalous/failed agent i â VA in
the motion space. By treating agent coordination as ideal
ï¬uid ï¬ow, we can exclude failed agent i â VA by wrap-
ping them with a closed surface Ï(x, y, t) = Ïi,0, where
Ïi,0 is constant. Furthermore, healthy vehicle j â VH
moves along the global desired trajectories

,

Ïj,c(t) = Ï(xj,c(t), yj,c(t), t) = Ïj,0 (constant).

(40)

where Ïj,0 is assigned based on position of vehicle j â VH
at the time the cooperative team enters the CEM.

obtained by taking time derivative from the generalized
coordinates, deï¬ne group desired coordination for CEM.
Note that uâ and Î¸â can be designed so that the ideal
ï¬uid ï¬ow coordination is optimized. However, the re-
maining design parameters are uncontrolled.
Remark 1. In general, design parameters (cid:219)uâ, (cid:219)Î¸â, (cid:219)âi,
(cid:219)ai, (cid:219)bi (i â VA) can vary with time. However, this paper

This section develops a hybrid model to manage tran-
sitions between CEM and HDM. Section 5.1 develops a
distributed approach to detect a vehicle failure/anomaly
followed by a supervisory control transition approach
described in Section 5.2.

5.1 Anomaly Detection

In this sub-section, we present a distributed model to
detect situations in which agents have failed or are
no longer cooperative. We then consider these agents
anomalous or failed and add them to anomalous agent
set VA.

Consider an n-D homogeneous deformation where fol-
lower i knows its own position and positions of in-
neighbor agents Ni = { j1, Â· Â· Â· jn+1} at any time t. Let
actual position ri(t) be expressed as the convex combi-
nation of agent iâs in-neighbors by

Geometric Interpretation of Transient Weights:
Let di, j2, j3(t), di, j3, j1 (t), and di, j1, j2(t) denote distances of
point i from the triangle sides j2 â j3, j3 â j1, and j1 â j2,
respectively. Assume lj1, j2, j3 (t), lj2, j3, j1(t), lj3, j1, j2(t) de-
termine distances of vertices j1,
j2, and j3 from the
triangle sides j2 â j3, j3 â j1, j1 â j2, respectively. Then,

Geometric representations of di, j2 j3(t) and lj1, j2 j3(t) are

For n = 3, di, j2, j3, j4 (t), di, j3, j4 j1 (t), di, j4, j1, j2(t), and
di, j1, j2, j3(t) denote distance of point i from the triangular
surfaces j2 â j3 â j4, j3 â j4 â j1, j4 â j1 â j2, j1 â j2 â j3, re-
spectively. Assume lj1, j2, j3, j4 (t), lj2, j3, j4, j1(t), lj3, j4, j1, j2 (t),

Theorem 3. Assume HDM collective motion is guided

Proof. If ri(t) = ri,c(t) for every agent i â V at any
time t, then (cid:36)i, jk (t) = wi, jk (k = 1, Â· Â· Â· , n + 1, jk â Ni).
For n = 2, we deï¬ne a desired triangle j1 â j2 â j3 with
vertices placed at rj1,c, rj2,c, and rj3,c. Di, j2, j3 denotes
the distance between the global desired position of agent
i and the triangle side j2, j3 while Lj1, j2, j3 denotes the
distance between the desired position of agent j1 and the
side j2 â j3 of the desired tetrahedron. We also deï¬ne
an âactualâ triangle with vertices positioned at rj1, rj2,
and rj3. When (cid:107)ri(t) â ri,c(t)(cid:107) â¤ â is satisï¬ed for agent

rj4,c; vertices of the âactualâ tetrahedron are positioned
at rj1 , rj2, rj3, and rj3. Di, j1, j2, j3 denotes the distance

tance between the desired position of agent j and the

6 Simulation Results

Consider collective motion in a 2-D plane with invariant
z components for all agents at all times t. Suppose a
multi-agent team consisting of 22 vehicles is deployed
with the initial formation shown in Fig. 2. Given global
desired positions of all agents at time t, the containment
domain â¦com is deï¬ned for this case study as:

The Fig. 5 ï¬owchart illustrates how vehicle failure can
be managed by transition between âHDMâ and âCEMâ.
The following procedure is proposed:

Team collective motion is deï¬ned by a homogeneous
transformation over t â [0, 100], where agents are all
healthy. Agents i1 = 1, i2 = 2, and i3 = 3 are the leaders
deï¬ning the homogeneous transformation. Given lead-

t â [100, 100.35]s thus CEM is activated. At t = 118.92s,
agent 11 is no longer inside the containment box â¦con. There-
fore, HDM is activated.

at any time t because agents are treated as particles of
a 2-D continuum and the desired homogenous deforma-
tion coordination is also two dimensional. Follower ve-
hicles apply the communication graph shown in Fig. 2
to acquire the desired coordination by local communi-
cation. The communication graph is strictly 3-reachable
per Section 4.1. Given initial positions of all agents, ev-
ery follower chooses three in-neighbor agents using the
approach described in Section 4.1. Consequently, the
graph shown in Fig. 4.1 assigns inter-agent communica-
tion, where followersâ communication weights are con-
sistent with agentsâ positions at reference time t = 0 and
obtained by (24). As shown Fig. 4, HDM is active before
an anomaly situation arises at time t = 100s.

In Fig. 9, actual paths of the healthy agents, de-
ï¬ned by VH = {1, Â· Â· Â· , 10, 12, Â· Â· Â· , 22} are shown for
t â [100.35, 118.92]. Green markers show positions of
healthy agents at t = 100.35s when they enter CEM;
black markers show positions of healthy agents at
t = 118.92s when CEM ends. Failed agent 11 is wrapped
by a disk of radius 4m centered at (205.26, 55.62) in this
example.

6.3 Motion Phase 3 (HDM)

CEM continues until switching time 118.92s when failed
agent 11 leaves containment box â¦con. Fig. 10 shows the
agentsâ conï¬guration at time t = 118.92. Followers use
the method from Section 4.1 to ï¬nd their in-neighbors
as well as communication weights. HDM remains active
after t = 118.92 since no other agents fail in this sim-
ulation. x and y components of actual agent positions
were plotted versus time for t â [118.92, 168.92]s earlier
in Fig. 6.

7 Conclusion

This paper develops a hybrid cooperative control strat-
egy with two operational modes to manage large-scale
coordination of agents in a resilient fashion. The ï¬rst
mode (HDM) treats agents as particles of a deformable
body and is active when all agents are healthy. HDM
guarantees agents can safely initialize and coordinate
their motions using the unique features of homogeneous
deformation coordination. A new CEM cooperative
paradigm was proposed to handle cases in which one or
more vehicles in the shared motion space fail to admit
the desired coordination. In CEM the desired vehicle
coordination is treated as an ideal ï¬uid ï¬ow and failed

vehicles are excluded by closed curves. Therefore, de-
sired trajectories for the remaining healthy vehicles can
be planned and collective motion safety for healthy
vehicles can still be guaranteed with low computation
overhead. To automatically initiate transition to CEM,
this paper contributes a strategy for quickly detecting
agent failure using the unique properties of the ho-
mogeneous deformation coordination. Future work is
needed to relax motion constraints on failed vehicles
and present simulation results with realistic vehicle
dynamics and more complex environments.
