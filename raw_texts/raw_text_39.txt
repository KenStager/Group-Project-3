Abstract

In this report we show the emergent behavior of a group of agents,
ordered from 1 to n, performing deviated, linear, cyclic pursuit, in
the presence of a broadcast guidance control. Each agent senses the
relative position of its target, i.e. agent i senses the relative position
of agent i + 1. The broadcast control, a velocity signal, is detected
by a random set of agents in the group. We assume the agents to be
modeled as single integrators. We show that the emergent behavior
of the group is determined by the deviation angle and by the set of
agents detecting the guidance control.

Introduction

The work presented in this report is a ï¬rst follow-up of the report âGuidance
of Agents in Cyclic Pursuitâ, see [14], where the problem of (direct) linear
and non-linear cyclic pursuit, in the presence of a broadcast velocity con-
trol detected by a random set of agents in the group, has been thoroughly
investigated. In the existing literature, âcyclic pursuitâ is meant to be an
autonomous system of n agents, ordered from 1 to n, which behaves ac-
cording to the following rule: agent i chases agent i + 1 and agent n chases
agent 1. In the sequel all indices associated with agents are modulo(n)
and agent i + 1 is deï¬ned as the target of agent i.

As in our previous work, we assume the agents to be identical, memory-
less, particles, modeled as single integrators. Each agent can sense the rel-
ative position of its target but its own absolute location is unknown. The
orientation of all local coordinate systems is aligned to that of the global
coordinate system, i.e. agents are assumed to have compasses enabling them
to align their local reference frames to a global reference direction (a common
north).

In autonomous linear deviated cyclic pursuit, each agent moves in a di-

rection rotated by an angle Î¸ from the line of sight to its target.

Let pi(t) be the position of agent i at time t; pi(t) â R2. Then, the rule

of movement for agent i, in the autonomous system is

where R(Î¸) is the rotation matrix

Ëpi(t) = R(Î¸)(pi+1(t) â pi(t))

R(Î¸) = [ cos(Î¸)

sin(Î¸)
]
âsin(Î¸) cos(Î¸)

This rule of movement is illustrated in Fig. 1 where ui(t) = (pi+1(t) â pi(t)).

Figure 1: Illustration of deviated pursuit

The deviation angle Î¸ is assumed to be constant and common to all agents.

1.1 Literature survey

Various researchers have treated the problem of formations obtained in au-
tonomous cyclic pursuit, without external input. In the sequel we refer to
those considering agents modeled as single-integrators with linear dynamics.
The problem of linear agreement algorithms for agents with single integrator
kinematics, over general topologies, was vastly investigated (see e.g. [3],[7],
[6], [13]). Cyclic pursuit is a particular unidirectional topology where each
agent receives information from a single neighbor, its target.

Lin et al. consider in [5] n ordered and numbered points in the complex
plane, each representing a freely mobile agent. They show that when the
agents are in linear cyclic pursuit they converge to the centroid of the points
and the centroid is stationary. Moreover, other formations are achievable by
a simple modiï¬cation, where each agent chases a âï¬xedâ displacement of its
target.

Sinha and Goose, [15], consider a group of autonomous mobile agents,

5

with identical behavior rules but with generally diï¬erent control gains

Ëpi = ui
ui = ki(pi+1 â pi)

for i = 1, . . . , n. They show that, by suitably selecting the gains ki, the
collective behavior of the agents can be controlled to obtain not only a point
of convergence but also directed motion, where the trajectories of all the
agents converge to a straight line as t â â, (see conditions in Theorem 3,
Theorem 4).

Pavone and Frazzoli, [8], generalize the (linear) cyclic pursuit strategy
to deviated cyclic pursuit, in the context of geometric pattern formation.
They show that n agents operating in R2, in deviated cyclic pursuit, with a
common oï¬set angle Î¸, will eventually converge to a single point, a circle or
an ever expanding logarithmic spiral pattern, depending on the value of Î¸,
as follows:

â¢ if â£Î¸â£ < Ï/n, to a single point, determined by the initial positions of the

agents (the initial centroid)

â¢ if â£Î¸â£ = Ï/n, to an evenly spaced circle formation, with radius determined

by the initial positions of the agents

â¢ if Ï/n < â£Î¸â£ < 2Ï/n, to an evenly spaced, ever expanding, logarithmic

spiral formation.

Ramirez et al. in [10], [9], extended these results in three directions:

1. the agents move in R3

2. control of the center of the formation by modifying the autonomous

velocity control

If kc > 0 then

ui = R(Î¸)(pi+1 â pi) â kcpi;
Ëpi = ui

kc â¥ 0

2.1. the center of the formation is no longer determined by the initial
positions of the agents, instead it always converges, exponentially
fast, to the origin.

6

2.2. each agent is required to know not only the relative position to its
target but also its own position, (in contradiction to our require-
ments here).

3. control the radius of the evenly-spaced circular formations.

The key idea here is to relax the assumption of a common deviaton
angle, Î¸, and make the deviation angle of each agent, Î¸i, a function of
the location of the agents and the desired inter-agent distance. In this
case, the rule of motion (1) becomes

Ëpi = R(Î¸i)(pi+1 â pi)

where

Î¸i = Ï
n

+ kth(r â â¥pi+1 â piâ¥);

r, kth > 0

and r is the desired inter-agent distance and kth is a gain.

Ren considered more general topologies and shows that collective motions
including rendezvous, circular patterns, and logarithmic spiral patterns can
be achieved by introducing Cartesian coordinate coupling to existing con-
sensus algorithms. A particular case of coupling is the rotation matrix. In
[11] the eï¬ect of coordinates coupling, introduced by a rotation matrix, on
linear consensus algorithms for agents with single integrator kinematics was
considered. In this case, the rule of movement is

Ëpi = â
kâNi

R(Î¸)(pk â pi)

(3)

where R(Î¸) is the rotation matrix and Ni is the neighborhood of agent i,
representing a general network topology, in contrast to [8], where the anal-
ysis of a similar problem was limited to unidirectional ring topology (cyclic
pursuit). It is shown that both the network topology and the value of the ro-
tation angle aï¬ect the resulting collective motions. When the nonsymmetric
Laplacian matrix, representing the network topology, has certain properties
and the rotation angle is below, equal, or above a critical value, the agents
will eventually rendezvous, move on circular orbits, or follow logarithmic spi-
ral curves. In particular, when the agents eventually move on circular orbits,
the relative radius of the orbits is equal to the relative magnitude of the
components of a right eigenvector associated with a critical eigenvalue of the
nonsymmetric Laplacian matrix, in contrast to the common circular obits
obtained in case of cyclic pursuit (see [8]).

1.2 An Overview of The New Results

The contribution of this work is in the analysis of the impact of an ex-
ogenous velocity control on the emergent behavior of n agents performing
(autonomous) deviated linear cyclic pursuit. The exogenous velocity control,
we assume, is broadcast by a controller and detected by a random set of
agents from the group, that thereby become temporary (ad-hoc) âleadersâ
of the swarm.

In this case, the rule of movement (1) becomes

Ëpi(t) = R(Î¸)(pi+1(t) â pi(t)) + bi(t)Uc(t);

i = 1, ..., n

(4)

where

â¢ Uc(t) is the broadcast velocity vector signal at time t

â¢ bi(t) is the indicator of detection of Uc(t) by agent i, given by

bi =

otherwise

1.2.1 Group dynamics with broadcast control
Let P = [p1, p2, ...pn]T be the vector of stacked agent positions, where pi,
i =
1, . . . , n evolves according to eq. (4). The group dynamics of the system can
be written as:

ËP (t) = ËM P (t) + ËB(t)Uc(t)

where

â¢ ËM = M â R(Î¸), such that M is the circulant matrix (7):

The matrix M is time independent by its deï¬nition (see (7)). The as-
sumption of cyclic pursuit with a constant deviation angle makes R(Î¸), and
therefore ËM too, time independent. We assume the exogenous control, Uc(t),
and the set of agents detecting it, deï¬ned by the leaders indicator vector
B(t), to be piecewise constant. In the sequel we treat separately each inter-
val where Uc(t) and B(t) ( the set of agents detecting the exogenous control)
are constant and thus it is convenient to let t denote the relative time since
the beginning of the interval and P (0) the state of the system at the moment
of change, deï¬ned to be t = 0.
Remark 1.1. The behavior of the group of agents in multiple intervals, where
Uc and/or B change at the start of each new interval and the end conditions
of one interval are the start conditions of the next interval, is discussed and
illustrated by simulation in section 3.2.2.
In each interval eq. (6) becomes

ËP (t) = ËM P (t) + ËBUc

(9)

i.e. the system evolves as a linear time independent system (LTI) with the
well known solution (10), (see [4]).

1.2.2 The resulting emergent behavior

Given an external broadcast control, Uc, the emergent behavior of the group is
a function of the deviation angle Î¸, the critical angle, Î¸c = Ï
and the (random)
n

9

subset of agents detecting the broadcast control (leaders), represented by the
leaders indicator vector B. We have the following results:

â¢ if Î¸ < Î¸c then

â if B = 1n, i.e. all agents detect the broadcast control signal, then

the asymptotic behavior of the group is given by

pi(t â â) = pc + Uct;

i = 1, . . . , n

where pc is the centroid of the initial positions. Thus, if all agents
detect the broadcast control, the agents will eventually gather and
move as a single point with velocity Uc on a line anchored at pc.

â if B â  1n then

pi(t â â) = pc + nl
n

Uct + ÏiR(âÎ¸)Uc;

i = 1, . . . , n

In this case, all agents will eventually move with velocity nl
parallel lines anchored at pc + ÏiR(âÎ¸)Uc, where
â nl is the number of agents detecting Uc.
â ÏiR(âÎ¸)Uc is the asymptotic deviation of the anchor of the
movement line of agent i from the centroid pc and Ïi is a
function of B, i.e. of the set of leaders (see section 2.2.2)

n Uc on

Therefore, the agents will asymptotically align in a linear forma-
tion, rotated by âÎ¸ from the direction of Uc, and the formation
will move with velocity

Uc.

Remark 1.2. We observe that the circular formation and its characteristics
(radius and angular distances between agents) are independent of the broad-
cast control Uc and the set of agents detecting it. These inï¬uence only the
center of the orbit and its movement.

Remark 1.3. The emergent behavior for the various deviation angles, summa-
rized above, is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix ËM (see Appendix
D.1). We note that if Î¸ > Î¸c then then ËM has at least two non-zero eigen-
values which lie in the open right-half complex plane causing the position of
the agents to spiral out. This is an unstable system which is not discussed
herein.

The emergent behaviors are rigorously derived in section 2 and illustrated

by simulations in section 3.

1.3 Preliminaries - Properties of the matrix ËM
The following properties of the matrix ËM are used in the sequel for the
derivation of the emergent behavior of the system, P (t â â), evolving under
(9).

11

â¢ ËM is a normal matrix (see Lemma C.1), therefore it is unitarily diago-

nizable, i.e.

where

ËM = ÎÎÎâ

â¢ For n agents in linear cyclic pursuit with common deviation angle Î¸,
n , (see Corollary 2 in Appendix D.1.1),

there exists a critical value Î¸c = Ï
such that

(a) if â£Î¸â£ < Î¸c, then ËM has two zero eigenvalues, ÂµÂ±
eigenvalues lie in the open left-half complex plane

0 , and all other

(b) if â£Î¸â£ = Î¸c, then ËM has two zero eigenvalues, ÂµÂ±

0 , and two non-zero
eigenvalues which lie on the imaginary axis, while all remaining
eigenvalues lie in the open left-half complex plane. The eigenvalues
nâ1 and Âµâ
on the imaginary axis are Âµ+
1

(c) if â£Î¸â£ > Î¸c, then ËM has two zero eigenvalues and at least two non-
zero eigenvalues which lie in the open right-half complex plane,
therefore this is an unstable system which shall not be dis-
cussed herein. The agents in this case spread out and cease to
remain in a ï¬nite extent constellation.

2 Derivation of The Emergent Behavior

We consider a piecewise constant time interval of a system evolving according
to eq. (9), with a solution given by eq. (10). Since the emergent behavior
is given by P (t â â) we assume that the dwell time of the interval is long
enough to approach the asymptotic behavior. We recall (see eq. (10))

P (t) = e ËM tP (0) + â«

nâ1, Âµâ

ËM have negative real part. Thus, â(h0)

3 Demonstration by Simulation

In this section we illustrate by simulation the impact of the deviation angle
Î¸, of the broadcast control, Uc(t), and of the set of leaders (agents detecting
the broadcast control) on the emergent behavior of a group of agents in
linear, deviated, cyclic pursuit. We recall that the set of agents detecting the
broadcast control is represented by the vector B, such that B(i) = 1 if agent
i detected the broadcast signal and B(i) = 0 otherwise.

We present results for

1. Single time interval

1.1. Autonomous deviated linear cyclic pursuit, without external con-

trol

1.2. The broadcast control and the set of leaders are constant in the

time interval, i.e. Uc(t) = Uc, B(t) = B for t â [0, Tmax]

2. Multiple time intervals, where the time line [0, Tmax] is divided in piece-
k = 0, ....m â 1, where m is the

wise constant time intervals [tk, tk+1];
number of intervals and

â¢ Uc(t) = Uc(tk) if t â [tk, tk+1)
â¢ B(t) = B(tk) if t â [tk, tk+1)

23

â¢ The start state of a new interval is the end state of the previous

interval

In all shown simulation results we assumed n = 5, where n is the number

of agents.

3.1 Autonomous deviated cyclic pursuit

In this section we illustrate the emergent behavior of the autonomous devi-
ated cyclic pursuit, i.e. with Uc = (0, 0)T , as a function of the deviation angle
Î¸, corresponding to the analytically obtained results (see section 2.1). We
recall that Î¸c = 2Ï
. Therefore, for n = 5 we have Î¸c = 36deg.
n
We show, starting from two initial topologies, shown in Figures 2, (see

Example1) and 5,(see Example2), that

â¢ if Î¸ < Î¸c then the agents gather to pc, the centroid of the agentsâ initial

positions, see Figures 3 and 6. In these ï¬gures

â pc is the displayed initial centroid
â pi(Tmax) â¶= (xi(Tmax, yi(Tmax))T
â pi(Tmax) == pc âi, as expected.

â¢ if Î¸ = Î¸c then the agents will rotate around pc on a common orbit with a
radius (displayed as r) depending on the initial positions of the agents,
see Figures 4 and 7.

In these ï¬gures we show the trajectories of the agents,
pi(t); i = 1, . . . , n; t â [0, Tmax] and the circular component of the trajec-
tories (shown in black). We note that the center of the circular orbit
is pc, as expected.

cast control)

â¢ a dotted line represents a follower (an agent that does not detect the

3.2.1 Single time interval

We recall that the emergent behavior, analytically derived in section 2, is
an asymptotic behavior. Thus, in order to compare the numerical results,
obtained by simulation to the analytically derived results we need the simu-
lation time, Tmax to be long enough to approximate t â â. We found that
Tmax = 60 is such a time. Therefore all presented simulations were run with
Tmax = 60 (Points=60000, dT=0.001). However, for visualization purposes
all trajectories and velocities are shown for the ï¬rst part of the data, up to
t = 10.

For the simulations presented in this section we used Uc = (2, 3)T and we

considered the following cases

1. Î¸ = 20deg(< Î¸c)

1.1. Uc is detected by all the agents, i.e. B = 1n
1.2. Uc is detected only by agents 2 and 5, i.e B = (0, 1, 0, 0, 1)T

2. Î¸ = 36deg(= Î¸c)

2.1. Uc is detected by all the agents, i.e. B = 1n
2.2. Uc is detected only by agents 2 and 5, i.e B = (0, 1, 0, 0, 1)T

In this case all the agents converge to a point (see xTmax, yTmax in Fig. 8)

9), as expected.

We complete the demonstration of the emergent behavior of the agents

center for Î¸ = 20deg vs 0deg, see Fig. 12. We observe that in both cases the

35

agents are aligned in a linear formation. While for Î¸ = 0 the formation is
aligned with Uc for Î¸ = 20the formation is aligned with R(âÎ¸)Uc, where R
denotes the rotation matrix, complying with eq.(46).

3.2.2 Multiple piecewise constant intervals

A new interval starts upon a change of broadcast velocity control, Uc, or a
change in the set of agents detecting it, represented by the vector B(t). The
initial state of each interval is the end state of the previous interval.

In this section we show the emergent behavior of the same group of ï¬ve
agents, starting at the same initial positions, Fig. 5, over multiple intervals,
with piecewise constant Uc(t) and B(t).

We show two cases of piecewise constant systems, Uc(t) = (ux(t), uy(t))T
and B(t), and for each system we show the emergent behavior, trajectories
and velocities, for Î¸ < Î¸c and Î¸ = Î¸c.

CaseM.1 U (t) as shown in Fig. 17, B(t) as follows

â¢ for t â [0, 45) the set of agents detecting the broadcast control is

{2, 5}, i.e. B(t) = (0, 1, 0, 0, 1)T

â¢ for t â [45, 60] the set of agents detecting the broadcast control is

âallâ, i.e. B(t) = 15

CaseM.2 U (t) as shown in Fig. 18, B(t) as follows

â¢ for t â [0, 45) the set of agents detecting the broadcast control is

{2, 5}, i.e. B(t) = (0, 1, 0, 0, 1)T

â¢ for t â [45, 52.5) the set of agents detecting the broadcast control

is âallâ, i.e. B(t) = 15

â¢ for t â [52.5, 60] the set of agents detecting the broadcast control

is again {2, 5}, i.e. B(t) = (0, 1, 0, 0, 1)T

We observe that the emergent behavior over multiple time intervals is a

concatenation of the single intervals, as expected.

We note that what seems like an irregular circular movement in case Î¸ = Î¸c
and B â  1n, see Fig. 21, 25, is actually due to changes in the deviation of the
centers upon change in Uc(t). (We recall that the deviation of the centers is
given by eq. 46: â(u1)
= ÏiR(âÎ¸)Uc). To demonstrate this claim we show the
emergent behavior with the same Uc(t) (see Fig. 18) in case B = 1n, when
the centers overlap, i.e. there are no deviations.

4 Summary and discussion

In this work we apply well known LTI systems evolution theory to a novel
paradigm where agents in deviated linear cyclic pursuit are exposed to a
piecewise constant broadcast control, detected by a random subset of agents.
The emergent behavior of the agents is rigorously derived for a single time
interval and illustrated by simulations for multiple time intervals, a concate-
nation of single time intervals. The emergent behavior of the swarm is shown
to be a function of the deviation angle, Î¸, the critical deviation angle Î¸c = Ï

and of the (random) subset of agents detecting the broadcast control (ad-hoc
leaders). We show that the emergent pattern of movement depends only on
the deviation angle Î¸, such that

â¢ if Î¸ < Î¸c the movement is linear and the asymptotic velocity of the
is the ratio of

Uc, where Uc is the broadcast control and

nl

= 1 then the agents gather and move as a single point.

< 1 then the agents will asymptotically move as a time inde-
pendent linear formation rotated by R(âÎ¸) from the direction of
Uc.

â¢ if Î¸ = Î¸c the movement is circular around a center moving with velocity
Uc. The radius of the circular orbit is a function of the number of

We plan in the future to investigate the emergent behavior of non-linear
agents, sensing bearing-only (bugs), in deviated cyclic pursuit, under the
inï¬uence of broadcast control detected by a random subset of agents.

Appendix A General results on matrices

Following [2], let Mn denote the class of all n Ã n matrices. Two matrices
A, B â Mn are similar, denoted by A â¼ B, if there exists an invertible (non-
singular) matrix S â Mn s.t. A = SBSâ1. Similar matrices are just diï¬erent
basis representation of a single linear transformation.Similar matrices have
the same characteristic polynomial, c.f. Theorem 1.3.3 in [2] and therefore
the same eigenvalues

A.1 Algebraic and geometric multiplicity of eigenval-

ues

Let Î» be an eigenvalue of an arbitrary matrix A â Mn with an associated
eigenvector v â Cn.
Deï¬nitions:

â¢ The spectrum of A â Mn is the set of all the eigenvalues of A, denoted

by Ï(A).

â¢ The spectral radius of A is Ï(A) = maxâ£Î»â£ â¶ Î» â Ï(A).

â¢ For a given Î» â Ï(A) , the set of all vectors v â Cn satisfying Av = Î»v
is called the eigenspace of A associated with the eigenvalue Î» . Every
nonzero element of this eigenspace is an eigenvector of A associated
with Î»

â¢ The algebraic multiplicity of Î» is its multiplicity as a root of the char-

acteristic polynomial det(Î»I â A)

â¢ The geometric multiplicity of Î» is the dimension of the eigenspace as-
sociated with Î», i.e. the number of linearly independent eigenvectors
associated with that eigenvalue.

â¢ We say that Î» is simple if its algebraic multiplicity is 1; it is semisimple

if its algebraic and geometric multiplicities are equal.

â¢ The algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue is larger than or equal to its

geometric multiplicity.

55

â¢ We say that A is defective if the geometric multiplicity of some eigen-

value is less than its algebraic multiplicity

A.2 Diagonizable matrices
Deï¬nition: If A â Mn is similar to a diagonal matrix, then A is said to be
diagonizable

Theorem 1. See Theorem 1.3.7 in [2].

The matrix A â Mn is diagonizable iï¬ there are n linearly indepen-
If

dent vectors, v(1), v(2), ...., v(n), each of which is an eigenvector of A.
v(1), v(2), ...., v(n) are linearly independent eigenvectors of A and S = [v(1), v(2), ...., v(n)]
then Sâ1AS is a diagonal matrix Î and the diagonal entries of Î are the
eigenvalues of A

Lemma 1. Let Î»1, ..., Î»k;
pose v(i) is an eigenvector associated with Î»i;
[v(1), v(2), ...., v(k)] are linearly independent.

k â¥ 2 be distinct eigenvalues of A â Mn and sup-
i = 1, ...., n. Then the vectors

Proof of Lemma 1.3.8 in [2]

Theorem 2. If A â Mn has n distinct eigenvalues, then A is diagonizable

Proof. Since all eigenvalues are distinct Lemma 1 ensures that the associated
eigenvectors are linearly independent and thus, according to Theorem 1, A
QED
is diagonizable

Notes:

1. Having distinct eigenvalues is suï¬cient for diagonizability, but not nec-

essary.

2. A matrix is diagonizable iï¬ it is non-defective, i.e. it has no eigenvalue
with geometric multiplicity strictly less than its algebraic multiplicity

A.3 Left eigenvectors
Deï¬nition: A non-zero vector y â Cn is a left eigenvector of A â Mn asso-
ciated with eigenvalue Î» of A if yâA = Î»yâ. From [2], Theorem 1.4.12, we
have the following relationship between left and right eigenvectors and the
multiplicities of the corresponding eigenvalue:

56

Theorem 3. Let Î» â C be an eigenvalue of A â Mn associated with right
eigenvector x and left eigenvector yâ. Then the following hold:

(a) If Î» has algebraic multiplicity 1, then yâx â  0

(b) If Î» has geometric multiplicity 1, then it has algebraic multiplicity 1 iï¬

yâx â  0

A.4 Square matrices decomposition

â¢ If A â Mn with distinct eigenvectors (not necessarily distinct eigenval-
ues) then A = V ÎV â1, where Î is a diagonal matrix formed from the
eigenvalues of A, and the columns of V are the corresponding eigen-
vectors of A.
A matrix A â Mn always has n eigenvalues, which can be ordered (in
more than one way) to form a diagonal matrix Î â Mn and a cor-
responding matrix of nonzero columns V that satisï¬es the eigenvalue
equation AV = V Î. If the n eigenvectors are distinct then V is invert-
ible, implying the decomposition A = V ÎV â1.
Comment: The condition of having n distinct eigenvalues is suï¬cient
but not necessary. The necessary and suï¬cient condition is for each
eigenvalue to have geometric multiplicity equal to its algebraic multi-
plicity.

â¢ If A is real-symmetric its n (possibly not distinct) eigenvalues are all
real with geometric multiplicity which equals the algebraic multiplicity.
V is always invertible and can be made to have normalized columns.
Then the equation V V T = I holds, because each eigenvector is orthonor-
mal to the other. Therefore the decomposition (which always exists if
A is real-symmetric) reads as: A = V ÎV T . This is known as the the
spectral theorem, or symmetric eigenvalue decomposition theorem.

â¢ If A â Mn is normal, i.e. AAT = AT A, then

1. There exists an orthonormal set of n eigenvectors of A
2. A is unitarily diagonizable, i.e. A = U ÎU â, where U is a unitary
matrix of eigenvectors and Î is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues
of A.

57

A.5 About non-symmetric real matrices

â¢ the eigenvalues of non-symmetric real n Ã n matrix are real or come in

complex conjugate pairs

â¢ the eigenvectors are not orthonormal in general and may not even span

an n-dimensional space

â Incomplete eigenvectors can occur only when there are degenerate
eigenvalues with algebraic multiplicity greater

eigenvalues, i.e.
than 1, but do not always occur in such cases

â Incomplete eigenvectors never occur for the class of normal ma-

trices

â¢ Diagonalization theorem: an n Ã n matrix A is diagonizable iï¬ A has n

linearly independent eigenvectors

A.6 Normal matrices
Deï¬nition 1. A matrix A â Mn is called normal if AâA = AAâ
Deï¬nition 2. A matrix A â Mn is called Hermitian if Aâ = A
Theorem 4. If A â Mn has eigenvalues Î»1, Î»2, ....., Î»n the following statements
are equivalent:

(a) A is normal

(b) A is unitarily diagonizable

(c) ân

i=1 ân
j=1

â£aijâ£2 = ân
j=1

â£Î»jâ£2

(d) There is an orthonormal set of n eigenvectors of A

Remark A.1. All normal matrices are diagonizable but not all diagonizable
matrices are normal.

A.7 Unitary matrices and unitary similarity
Unitary matrices, U â Mn, are non-singular matrices such that U â1 = U â, i.e
U âU = U U â = I. A real matrix U â Mn(R) is real orthogonal if U T U = I.
The following are equivalent:

58

(a) U is unitary

(b) U is non-singular and U â1 = U â

(c) U U â = I

(d) U â is unitary

(e) The columns of U are orthonormal

(f) The rows of U are orthonormal

(g) For all x â Cn,

â¥xâ¥2 = â¥U xâ¥2

Deï¬nition A.1. :

â¢ A is unitarily similar to B if there is a unitary matrix U s.t. A = U BU â

â¢ A is unitarily diagonizable if it is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix

B.1 Basic Properties

The properties of the Kronecker product in this subsection are only those
with bearing on this work. A complete list of properties can be found in [12].

â¢ Taking the transpose before carrying out the Kronecker product yields

the same result as doing so afterwards, i.e.

(A â B)T = AT â BT

(50)

â¢ The product of two Kronecker products yields another Kronecker prod-

uct:

(A â B)(C â D) = AC â BD; âA â Mp,q, B â Mr,s, C â Mq,k, D â Ms,l
(51)

â¢ Taking the complex conjugate before carrying out the Kronecker prod-

uct yields the same result as doing so afterwards, i.e.

(A â B)â = Aâ â Bâ; âA â Mp,q(C), B â Mr,s(C)

(52)

â¢ Denote by Ï(A) the spectrum of a square matrix A, i.e. the set of all

eigenvalues of A. Then, Theorem B.1 holds.
Theorem B.1. (Theorem 2.3 in [12]) Let A â Mm and B â Mn.
Furthermore, let Î» â Ï(A) with corresponding eigenvector x and let
Âµ â Ï(B) with corresponding eigenvector y. Then, Î»Âµ is an eigenvalue
of A â B with corresponding eigenvector x â y

C.1 Cyclic linear pursuit

The matrix M , representing cyclic pursuit, is a special case of circulant ma-
trix (see eq. (7) M = circ(â1, 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0).

Thus, using (55), the eigenvalues of M are

Î»k = â1 + eâ2Ïjk/n;

k = 0, ..., n â 1

(57)

and the eigenvectors are given by eq. (54).

Lemma C.1. M = circ(â1, 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) is a normal matrix, i.e. satisï¬es
M M T = M T M

Proof. By direct computation M M T = M T M = circ([2, â1, 0, ...., 0, â1]) QED

Appendix D Properties of the block circu-

lant matrix ËM

Consider now the block circulant matrix ËM , deï¬ned as in eq. (8), represent-
ing linear cyclic pursuit with a common deviation angle Î¸.

ËM = M â R(Î¸)

61

Thus, ËM = circ [âR(Î¸), R(Î¸), 02Ã2, ..., 02Ã2], where R(Î¸) is the rotation ma-
trix, deï¬ned by eq. (2)

Lemma D.1. The matrix ËM = M â R(Î¸), where M = circ(â1, 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0)
and R is a rotation matrix, is a normal matrix

Proof. Using the Kroenecker product properties and Lemma C.1 we prove
that ËM ËM T = ËM T ËM .

ËM ËM T = (M â R)(M â R)T = (M M T ) â (RRT ) = (M M T ) â I

Denote by ÂµÂ±

calling that ËM = (M â R(Î¸)) and applying theorem B.1, the eigenvalues of
ËM are products of the eigenvalues of M and of R(Î¸), while the eigenvectors

The following Lemma is well known in the linear algebra literature

Lemma D.3. If Î» is a complex eigenvalue of a real matrix A, with corre-
sponding, complex, eigenvector v, then Î» is also an eigenvalue of A, with
eigenvector v

Proof. By the deï¬nition of Î» and v, we have

Av = Î»v,

v â  0.

Taking complex conjugates of this equation, we obtain:

Av = Av = Î»v

where A = A since A is real. Therefore, Î» is also an eigenvalue of A, with
QED
eigenvector v

For the particular case of A = M , we have Î»0 = 0 and Î»nâ1 = Î»1
The eigenvectors of M are given by eq. (54), i.e.

Therefore, ak, bk are scalars deï¬ned by the number of agents and the
initial positions of the agents. Equivalently, (69) can be written as

Next, we show that the radius is common to all agents and the agents are

equally spaced on the orbit, at angular distances

.

E.3 Proof of movement on a common orbit
We consider agents k and k + 1 and show that Rk+1 = Rk for k = 1, . . . , n.
k = 2, . . . , n, i.e. R1 is the common radius.
Thus Rk = R1;

E.3.1 All orbits have a common radius

Given Ïkl = 2Ï(k â l)/n, see (64), we have

Since (81) holds for k = [1, . . . , n]mod(n) we have

E.4 Equal spacing between agents on the orbit

In this section we show that the angular distance between consecutive agents
is 2Ï

n , i.e. we show Î±k+1 = Î±k + 2Ï
n .
Corresponding to (74) we have

tan(Î±k+1) = ak+1
bk+1

Recalling (see eqs. (76) and (77)

ak+1 = ak cos(2Ï
n
bk+1 = bk cos(2Ï
n

) + bk sin(2Ï
n
) â ak sin(2Ï

)

tan(Î±k+1) =

ak cos( 2Ï
