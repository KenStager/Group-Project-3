Recent studies have revealed a paradoxical phenomenon in public goods games, wherein destruc-
tive agents, harming both cooperators and defectors, can unexpectedly bolster cooperation. Building
upon this intriguing premise, our paper introduces a novel concept: constructive agents, which con-
fer additional benefits to both cooperators and defectors. We investigate the impact of these agents
on cooperation dynamics within the framework of public goods games. Employing replicator dy-
namics, we find that unlike destructive agents, the mere presence of constructive agents does not
significantly alter the defective equilibrium. However, when the benefits from constructive agents
are outweighed by the damage inflicted by destructive agents, the coexistence of both agent types
can amplify the ability of destructive agents to sustain cooperation. This occurs through the facili-
tation of a coexistence pattern involving cooperators, defectors, constructive agents, and destructive
agents via cyclic dominance. Conversely, if the benefits from constructive agents surpass the harm
caused by destructive agents, the presence of constructive agents nullifies the ability of destructive
agents to foster cooperation. Our results highlights the nuanced dual role of constructive agents in
shaping cooperation dynamics, emphasizing the necessity of carefully assessing incentive balances
in evolutionary game theory.

INTRODUCTION

Cooperation can ensure the maximization of collective
interests, but it is also vulnerable to exploitation by âfree-
ridersâ who do not bear the costs of cooperation [1â3]. To
explore the emergence and maintenance of cooperation,
numerous studies rooted in the framework of evolution-
ary game theory have revealed the mechanisms that sup-
port the evolution of cooperation in individual interac-
tions [4â7]. These include direct reciprocity, established
through repeated interactions [8]; indirect reciprocity in-
volving information transfer [9]; and network reciprocity
arising from interaction structures [7]. However, in one-
shot games where individuals interact only once, with-
out the possibility of memory or behavioral information
transfer, these reciprocity mechanisms are absent, mak-
ing the maintenance of cooperation still a challenge [2].
To tackle cooperation challenges in one-shot games, re-
searchers have incorporated social mechanisms that al-
low individuals to engage in additional decision-making
stages after contributing to public goods in the public
goods game (PGG), unveiling pathways for establishing
cooperation. [5, 10â12]. These include allowing individu-
als to impose costly punishments [10, 13, 14] and rewards
[15, 16] on others based on contribution outcomes, decid-
ing whether to participate in the game before contribut-
ing to public goods (or called âlonerâ strategy) [17, 18],
or exiting from the interaction early for a fixed payoff

[19, 20]. From these game interactions, different behav-
iors can be observed. The framework of social value ori-
entation analyzes and summarizes these behaviors by ex-
ploring how individuals balance their own interests with
those of others[21, 22], aiding in understanding coopera-
tion issues in social dilemmas from a perspective of be-
havioral value orientation.

Recently, attention has been drawn to the impact of
sadistic-orientation behavior on the cooperation dynam-
ics, known as destructive behavior (or called âjokerâ
strategy) [23â25]. These âbad guysâ not only opt out of
contributing to public goods, but also engage in antiso-
cial behaviors that harm the interests of others. Counter-
intuitively, the presence of these destructive agents can
maintain cooperation through a cycle of dominance in-
volving cooperation, defection, and destructive strategies
[23], and these individualsâ positive effects on cooperation
remain robust in both infinite and finite populations [24].
However, in contrast to this sadistic-orientation behav-
ior, altruistic-orientation behavior is more commonly ob-
served in behavioral experiments [21, 26]. For instance,
some individuals exhibit a preference for engaging in al-
truistic rewarding behavior, even at a personal cost [27].
The complexity of human behavior leads to diversity in
actions and strategies in interactions [21, 22]. Taking this
into account, research further explores the evolutionary
dynamics of coexisting altruistic and antisocial behaviors
[28]. Interestingly, Szolnoki et al. [14] demonstrated that
antisocial punishment (punishing those who contribute
to the public good) can unexpectedly enhance the effec-
tiveness of prosocial punishment (punishing free-riders)
in structured populations, challenging conventional per-

spectives on prosocial/antisocial behaviors and revealing
new pathways for establishing cooperation. Importantly,
the dynamics created by diverse interaction strategies
provide a crucial perspective for a deeper understand-
ing of the emergence of cooperation in real-life scenarios,
which lie in the complexity of human behavior [29, 30].
Inspired by this, we introduce a new concept - con-
structive strategies, incorporating this altruistic behav-
ior into the PGG model involving cooperation, defection,
and destructive strategies. This approach enables us to
expand current research in solving the cooperation is-
sues by exploring the interconnected diverse behaviors
of cooperation dynamics. In contrast to the destructive
agents, constructive agents withdraw from game inter-
actions but provide additional costly benefits to partici-
pants without concern for their own gains or losses. Uti-
lizing replicator dynamics in an infinite population [31],
our research reveals that, although constructive agents
alone do not alter evolutionary dynamics, their presence
alongside destructive agents forms a cycle of dominance
involving four strategies that support the emergence of
cooperation. Additionally, constructive agents can am-
plify the role of destructive agents in promoting coop-
eration. However, when the benefits provided by con-
structive agents surpass the harm caused by destructive
agents, it can result in negative effects that diminish the
capacity of destructive agents to promote cooperation.
The dual role of constructive individuals emphasizes the
balancing impact of positive and negative incentive fac-
tors in evolutionary game dynamics, thereby enhancing
the understanding of the incentive forces shaping coop-
eration.

II. MODEL

To gain a deep understanding of how constructors in-
fluence the cooperation dynamics, we first examine a
three-strategy model that includes cooperation, defec-
tion, and construction within the PGG. We then explore
a four-strategy PGG model incorporating cooperation,
defection, construction, and destruction to study the evo-
lutionary dynamics of cooperation in the presence of both
constructive agents and destructive agents.

A. Public goods game with constructive agents

In a classic PGG involving N players, a cooperator
contributes c to the public pool (simplify without loss of
generality, set c = 1), while a defector contributes noth-
ing. The total amount in the public pool is multiplied
by a synergy factor r and then evenly distributed among
all participants. Defection is the only Nash equilibrium
strategy when the synergy factor for cooperators meets
1 < r < N [3]. When constructive agents are introduced,
these individuals neither contribute to nor benefit from
the public pool. Instead, they offer an additional benefit

2

of d2 > 0 to the participants (i.e., cooperators and de-
fectors). Let the number of cooperators among the other
individuals in the group be NC, and the number of con-
structive agents be NCA, satisfying 0 â¤ NC + NCA â¤ N ,
the payoff for a focal individual adopting cooperation
(C), defection (D), and constructive strategies (CA) can
be respectively expressed as follows:

ÏC =

r(NC + 1) + d2NCA
S1

â 1,

ÏD =

rNC + d2NCA
S1
ÏCA = 0,

,

(1)

where S1 = N â NCA is the number of non-constructive
agents in the group.

Consider an infinitely large and well-mixed popula-
tion consisting of cooperators, defectors, and construc-
tive agents, with proportions x, y, z, respectively (sat-
isfy x + y + z = 1 and 0 â¤ x, y, z â¤ 1). N individuals
are randomly selected from the population to form group
and play the PGG. The expected payoffs for the C, D,
and CA strategies can be calculated as follows:

III. RESULTS

B. Public goods game with constructive agents and
destructive agents

When considering the four-strategy model, destruc-
tive agents (denoted as DA), like CA, do not partici-
pate in public pool allocation and investment, but indis-
criminately reduce the payoffs of cooperators and defec-
tors by d1 [23]. Let NDA represent the number of de-
structive agents, and S2 denote the individuals who are
neither constructive agents nor destructive agents, i.e.,
S2 = N â NCA â NDA. Similar to Eq. (1), the payoffs
of focal players adopting C, D, CA, and DA strategies
within a group can be expressed as follows:

ÏC =

r (NC + 1) + d2NCA â d1NDA
S2

â 1,

ÏD =

rNC + d2NCA â d1NDA
S2
ÏDA = 0,
ÏCA = 0.

Let the proportion of C, D, CA and DA in an infinitely
large and well-mixed population be x, y, z, and w, respec-
tively (satisfy x + y + z + w = 1 and 0 â¤ x, y, z, w â¤ 1).
The expected payoffs for these four types of agents can
be calculated as follows:

where Â¯P = xPC + yPD + zPCA + wPDA is the average

Before presenting our research results, we review the
dynamics of the destructive agents in the traditional pub-
lic goods game [23, 24]. In a population of size N , as-
suming that M individuals hold the same strategy. The
invasion analysis in ref. [23] indicates that the destructive
agents can lead to three patterns of invasion under the pa-
rameter conditions 1 < r < rmax = N (M â 1)/(M â N )
and d1 > 0.
(i) In the region of r > 1 + (N â 1)d1,
destructive agents support the emergence of coopera-
tors trough a rock-paper-scissors (RPS) cyclic dominance
emerges.
(ii) In the region of 1 + d1/(M â 1) < r <
1 + (N â 1)d1, a bistability arises between the destructive
agents-cooperators. Here, the destructive agents can pre-
vail over the defector, while the defector dominates the
cooperator. However, neither the destructive agents nor
the cooperator can invade each other. (iii) In the region
of r < 1 + d1/(M â 1), the destructive agents dominates
in population.

When introducing the constructive agents solely, a
similar invasion analysis is conducted under the condi-
tions 0 < r < rmx and d2 > 0, see Appendix for de-
tailed analysis. The populationâs invasion state in the
presence of constructive agents is entirely different from
that introduced by destructive agents. Figure 1 illus-
trates that the population consistently favors D, since D
consistently maintain a positive expected payoff greater
than the other two types. But the competitive relation-
ship between C and CA is distinct. Region I: when
r < 1 â (N â 1)d2 , C can not invade constructive agents,
but CA agents can invade C, as the expected payoff for
the constructive agents is higher than that of cooperators.
Region II: When 1 â (N â 1)d2 < r < 1 â d2/(M â 1),
C and CA can invade each other, leading to a state of
antagonism. Region III: when r > 1 â d2/(M â 1), C
agents can invade CA, since the expected payoff of C
is greater than that of CA. To validate the theoretical
analysis, numerical simulations were conducted in three
regions, as illustrated in Figure 2. Consistent with theo-
retical predictions, across the three mentioned parameter

regions, there are variations in the competitive dynamics
between C and CA, with D consistently holding domi-
nance. These results indicate that when CA exists alone,
despite potentially benefiting others, it cannot effectively
resolve the social dilemma.

FIG. 2. The evolutionary dynamics of a a large, well-mixed
population involving strategies C, D, and CA are derived
from the replicator-mutator dynamics. Each vertex in the
plot represents a homogeneous population where all individ-
uals hold the same strategy. The three vertices correspond to
homogeneous populations adopting the strategies of coopera-
tion, defection, and constructive agents, respectively. Arrows
indicate the direction of dynamics, while blue-purple dots in-
dicate the convergence states of populations. Proximity to
a vertex indicates a higher proportion of the strategy repre-
sented by that vertex. Figures (a), (b), and (c) respectively
depict the evolutionary dynamics in region I (setting r = 0.35
and d2 = 0.125), Region II (setting r = 0.35 and d2 = 1.5),
and Region III (setting r = 3.5 and d2 = 1.5) as shown in
Figure 1. The results presented are generated using a modi-
fied version of the DeFinetti package [32].

strategy model (involving C, D, DA, and CA) as a function
of the damage d1 caused by destructive agents and the benefit
d2 provided by constructive agents. The red vertical axis on
the far right of each subfigure illustrates the coexistence of
strategies in the three-strategy model (involving C, D, and
DA) under the same parameters. The square brackets denote
the presence of cyclic dominance among strategies, while their
absence indicates the state of stable coexistence. The values
of r are 3.5, 2, 1, and 0.5 for (a)-(d) respectively, with a group
size of N = 5 and a mutation rate of Âµ = 0.005.

the range of d1 values conducive to cooperation. Coop-

Three patterns of invasion in the public goods
games involving cooperators (C), defectors (D) and construc-
tive agents (CA) under parameter phase r-d2. Region I (light
green area) satisfies the conditions r < 1 â (N â 1)d2, cooper-
ators are invaded by constructive agents, while both coopera-
tors and constructive agents are invaded by defectors. Region
II (light brown area) satisfies the conditions 1 â (N â 1)d2 <
r < 1 â d2/(M â 1), cooperators are invaded by constructive
agents, while both cooperators and constructive agents are
invaded by defectors. Region III (light yellow area) satisfies
the conditions r > 1 â d2/(M â 1), constructive agents are
invaded by cooperators, while both cooperators and construc-
tive agents are invaded by defectors. All these cases are appli-
cable under N > 1 and 0 < r < rmax = N (M â 1)/(M â N ).
Critical points are d2,1 = 1/(N â 1), d2,2 = M â 1.

To further explore the impact of constructive agents
on cooperation, we investigate the evolutionary dynam-
ics involving the C, D, DA, and CA strategies. The
coexistence of strategies obtained through numerical sim-
ulation of replicator-mutator equations is depicted in
Figure 3. Both the three-strategy model involving C,
D and DA strategy and the four-strategy model con-
sidered here demonstrate that cooperation occurs only
when the synergy factor is sufficiently large (i.e., r â¥ 2),

model, for a specific d2, as the âharmâ inflicted by DA
on participants (d1) increases, the population transitions
from a pure D (blue region) phase to a coexistence phase
of D + DA + CA (green region). Furthermore, as d1
continues to increase, the population shifts from the
D + DA + CA phase to the DA + CA (orange region)
phase when r is low, as illustrated in Figure 3(c) and (d).
Interestingly, a narrow region of four-strategy coexistence
(yellow region) emerges between the D + DA + CA phase
and the DA + CA phase when r is sufficiently large. In
contrast to the three-strategy model (shown on the right
red vertical axis in Figure 3) where cooperation is limited

d1 > d2. On the other hand, for a specific d1, increasing
the benefits provided by CA sustains cooperation within
the population. However, as d2 surpasses d1, cooperation
diminishes, leading to a transition from the four-strategy
coexistence phase to the D+DA+CA phase. Further in-
creases in d2 ultimately lead to the dominance of strategy
D.

other parameters are set as follows: N = 5, r = 3.5, and
Âµ = 0.005. In (a), the frequency of C briefly increases before
giving way to D. Strategy DA dominates the entire popula-
tion eventually. In (b), strategies C, D, and DA exhibit cyclic
dominance. The evolutionary process of strategy proportions

involving three strategiesâC, D, and DA. It is notewor-
thy that when d1 < 1, the cycle dominance can emerge
with C, D, and DA, as shown in Figure 5(b). How-
ever, when d1 > 1, the results in Figures 5(a), (c), and
(d) show that cycle dominance disappears and DA ulti-
mately comes to dominate. Overall, when both d1 and
d2 exceed 1, and satisfy d1 > d2, the cyclic dominance
among strategies can occur (see Figure 4). Yet, with the
increasing benefits from CA in the population, the cyclic
dominance among the four strategies disappears, indicat-
ing that the introduction of constructive factors weakens
the ability of destructive factors to maintain cooperation
within the population.

To further investigate the impact of d1 and d2 on the
dynamics of strategy evolution, we examine the coex-
istence of four strategies (C, D, DA, and CA) under
varying combinations of d1 and d2. Results from Fig-
ures 6(a) and (b) indicate that, for a fixed d1, a slight
increase in d2 leads to a reduction in the peak ampli-
tude of C during cyclic dominance oscillations (red solid
line). Particularly, this weakening trend becomes more
pronounced when d1 is slightly decreased, as illustrated
in Figures 6(c) and (d). This suggests that the increase in
benefit (d2) brought by the constructive agents weakens
the advantage of destructive agents in inducing cooper-
ators to dominate in the populationâs cyclic dynamics.
Decreasing d1 also weakens the advantage of cooperators

FIG. 4. Depicted are the frequency of the C (cooperator,
red solid line), D (defector, blue dashed line), DA (destructive
agents, magenta dotted line), and CA (constructive agents,
green dash-dotted line) as a function of time steps. d2 is set
to 0.65, 1.65, 3, and 4.5 for (a)-(d), respectively. The other
parameters are set as follows: d1 = 3, N = 5, r = 3.5, and
Âµ = 0.005.

Figure 4 illustrates the temporal evolution of four
strategies under a synergy factor of r = 3.5, providing
insight into the evolving dynamics within the population.
In Figure 4(a), the results indicate a transient increase in
the proportions of cooperators and defectors in the early
stages of evolution. Subsequently, both C and D decrease
while the proportions of CA and DA increase until stabil-
ity is reached, ultimately resulting in a coexistence state
of CA + DA. Due to the absence of competition between
the CA and DA, their proportions in the population are
equal at equilibrium. When d2 is increased to 1.65, the
population exhibits cyclic oscillations over time for these
four strategies, as shown in Figure 4(b). Specifically, the
proportion of D initially rises, then gives way to DA and
CA, after which both are gradually replaced by C. Then,
C is once again supplanted by D, forming a cycle. It is
this dominating cycle that enables the coexistence of co-
operators with the other three strategies. When d1 = d2,
as depicted in Figure 4(c), the dominance of the strat-
egy cycle gives way to the coexistence of D + DA + CA.
Finally, when the benefits brought by CA outweigh the
damage caused by DA (i.e., d2 > d1), Figure 4(d) shows
that defectors eventually dominate the population.

The impact of mutation rate on the cyclic dominance
phenomenon is depicted in Figure 7. When Âµ = 0.005,
it can be observed that the peak cooperation frequency
within the cyclic dominance reaches approximately 0.92.
However, as the mutation rate increases to 0.01, the peak
values for the dominance of all four strategies decrease.
Specifically, the peak value for cooperators drops from
0.92 to 0.188. When mutation rate increases to 0.1,

tion, the cyclic dominance phenomenon disappears, with

IV. DISCUSSION

The intertwined evolutionary dynamics of diverse be-
haviors could deepen understanding of how cooperation
is sustained amidst the complexity of human behavior.
In this work, we introduce constructive behaviors into

spectively. The other parameters are set as follows: N = 5,

minishes.

the traditional PGG, and consider the intertwined evolu-
tionary dynamics of constructive agents and destructive
agents. These constructive agents do not influence contri-
butions and allocations in the public pool. Instead, they
directly benefit participants in the PGG group (i.e., co-
operators and defectors). Through mean-field results de-
rived from the replicator-mutator equation and numerical
simulations, our research reveals significant differences in
the impact of constructive agents compared to destruc-
tive agents on the cooperation dynamics. While the pres-
ence of destructive agents can contribute to sustaining
cooperation by facilitating a strategy cycle dominance,
the sole participation of constructive agents in the evolu-
tionary dynamics fails to resolve cooperation issues in a
one-shot game, with defection still prevailing in the pop-
ulation (see Figure 1). However, introducing constructive
agents into the cooperation-defection-destruction model
can maintain cooperation through a four-strategy cycle
dominance process in evolution (see Figure 3).

Although constructive agents themselves can not di-
rectly alter the evolutionary outcomes of the population,
together with destructive agents, they can engage in a cy-
cle dominance involving four strategies to sustain coop-
eration (see Figure 3). Interestingly, constructive agents
can act as catalysts, influencing the impact of destruc-
tive agents in promoting cooperation. The presence of
constructors can expand the parameter region in which
destructive agents promote cooperation. However, as the
benefits provided by constructive agents increase, the ef-
ficiency of destructive agents in promoting cooperation

When the benefits provided by constructive
agents exceed the âharmâ caused by destructive agents
to individuals, it breaks the cyclic dominance and weak-
ens the ability of destructive agents to sustain coopera-
tion (see Figure 4). Furthermore, an increased mutation
rate can weaken the peak cooperation frequency in cyclic
dominance. Conversely, in the limit of rare mutation
rates, the phenomena of cyclic dominance among strate-
gies completely disappear, with the defective strategy be-
ing the unique Nash equilibrium. Neither destructive nor
constructive agents derive any benefits from a common
pool of funds. However, relying solely on altruistic be-
havior from constructive agents is insufficient to support
the establishment of cooperation in one-shot games. Im-
portantly, the altruistic behavior of constructive agents
provides positive incentives for others in society, while
the behavior of destructive agents generates negative in-
centives. By simultaneously considering these positive
and negative incentive behaviors [11, 12, 14], the dynam-
ics of cooperation maintenance are altered. Therefore,
our study highlights the importance of balancing the in-
teraction of positive and negative incentive behaviors.

In our study, constructive and destructive agents repre-
sent two typical orientations towards the interests of oth-
ers: benefiting others and causing harm to others. How-
ever,
individual self-interest considerations have been
overlooked. Considering that self-interest is a charac-
teristic of rational human behavior, an integration of in-
dividual actions build upon two dimensions of behavioral
orientation within the social value orientation framework
[21]âpreference for oneâs own gains and preference for op-
ponentâs gainsâwill contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of cooperation emergence and promotion
under diverse behavioral frameworks. On the other hand,
in this challenging one-shot game scenario, cooperation
cannot be sustained by relying solely on the constructive
agents. In conjunction with reciprocity mechanisms, can
the altruistic behaviors exhibited by constructive agents,
promote the development of cooperation? Furthermore,
by integrating behavioral information transmission, ana-
lyzing the biased strategies of constructive and destruc-
tive agents towards defectors or cooperators becomes fea-
sible, aiding in a deeper understanding of how diverse
behaviors affect the cooperation dynamics. Future re-
search focusing on direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity,
and network reciprocity mechanisms will offer valuable
insights into the complex interplay between diverse indi-
vidual value orientations and the maintenance of cooper-
ation.

APPENDIX A. FINITE POPULATIONS:
INVASION ANALYSIS

Considering a homogeneous population of size M ,
where individuals adopt strategy Y . Suppose one indi-
vidual undergoes a mutation, shifting from strategy Y to
strategy X. The successful invasion of this homogeneous
population by the X individual is contingent upon the
condition that the expected payoff from adopting strat-
egy X exceeds that of individuals adopting strategy Y
(i.e., PX > PY ).
In this population, composed of one
individual adopting strategy X and N â 1 individuals
adopting strategy Y , the expected payoff for the individ-
uals using strategy X can be represented as follows:

PX = ÏX (1X, (N â 1)Y ).

(A.1)

During the game, individuals adopting strategy Y face
two possible population states: one where one individual
holds strategy X and N â 1 individuals hold strategy
Y , and the other where all individuals hold strategy Y .
Letâs denote the probabilities of these two states as p1
and p2 respectively. The expected payoff for strategy Y
can be expressed as:

PY = ÏY (1X, (N â 1)Y ) Â· p1
+ÏY (0X, N Y ) Â· p2,

In a model involving C, D, and CA strategies, consid-
ering the pairwise interaction of these strategies, there
are six distinct scenarios regarding population composi-
tion, as outlined below:

PD = ÏD(1D, (N â 1)C)

when r satisfies condition (A.10), the strategy CA can
never invade the population of strategy C.

Strategy D will successfully invade the population of
strategy C, satisfying the PD > PC, the condition can
be derived as follows:

r < N Â·

(A.6)

In the limit M â â , the above condition is reduced
to r < N , thereby encompassing the condition for the
social dilemma: 0 < r < N . In the subsequent analysis,
we will proceed under the assumption that inequality
(A.6) holds.

(A.7)
Since 0 < r < N , we have PC < 0 and PD > 0,
indicating PC < PD. Therefore, strategy C can never
invade a population of strategy D.

strategy C will invade the population of strategy CA iff
condition (A.12) holds.

On the contrary, if PC < PCA , i.e.,

r < 1 â (N â 1) Â· d2,

(A.13)

in this case, the strategy C will not invade the popula-
tion of strategy CA.

(E) 1D + (M â 1)CA

PCA = 0,

PD = ÏD(1D, (N â 1)CA)

(A.14)

= d2 Â· (N â 1).

Since d2 > 0 and N > 1, it follows that d2(N â 1) > 0,
i.e., PD > PCA. When this condition is satisfied, the

(A.15)
Since d2 > 0 and M â« 1, it follows that PD > 0. In
this case, PCA < PD must hold, so the strategy CA will
never invade the population of strategy D.

According to the invasion analysis described above,
we have obtained the distinct invasion regions for three
strategies as shown in Figure 1. In scenarios (A), (B),
(E), and (F), it is evident that when conditions 0 <
r < N Â· M â1
M âN and d2 > 0 are satisfied, both strategy
C and strategy CA are consistently invaded by strategy
D. From scenarios (C) and (D), although r > 1 â d2
M â1 is

satisfied, strategy CA does not invade strategy C. How-
ever, when r > 1 â (N â 1) Â· d2, strategy CA is invaded
by strategy C. Notably, the range of r values in the for-
mer falls within that of the latter, thus, as long as the
condition r > 1 â d2
M â1 holds, the latter will definitely
occur, namely, strategy CA being invaded by strategy
C. Similarly, although r < 1 â (N â 1) Â· d2 is satisfied,

strategy C does not invade strategy CA. However, when
0 < r < 1 â d2
M âN , strategy C is invaded by strategy CA.
The range of r values in the former is contained within
the range of the latter, thus, when r < 1 â (N â 1) Â· d2 is
satisfied, strategy C will eventually be invaded by strat-
egy CA. In contrast, when 1â(N â1)Â·d2 < r < 1â d2
M â1 ,
strategies CA and C invade each other, leading to a state
of antagonism.
