Reaching a Consensus in Networks of

High-Order Integral Agents under Switching

1

Directed Topology

Long Cheng, Zeng-Guang Hou, and Min Tan

Abstract

Consensus problem of high-order integral multi-agent systems under switching directed topology is

considered in this study. Depending on whether the agentâs full state is available or not, two distributed

protocols are proposed to ensure that states of all agents can be convergent to a same stationary value.

In the proposed protocols, the gain vector associated with the agentâs (estimated) state and the gain

vector associated with the relative (estimated) states between agents are designed in a sophisticated

way. By this particular design, the high-order integral multi-agent system can be transformed into

a ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent system. And the convergence of the transformed ï¬rst-order integral

agentâs state indicates the convergence of the original high-order integral agentâs state if and only if

all roots of the polynomial, whose coefï¬cients are the entries of the gain vector associated with the

relative (estimated) states between agents, are in the open left-half complex plane. Therefore, many

analysis techniques in the ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent system can be directly borrowed to solve the

problems in the high-order integral multi-agent system. Due to this property, it is proved that to reach

a consensus, the switching directed topology of multi-agent system is only required to be âuniformly

jointly quasi-strongly connectedâ, which seems the mildest connectivity condition in the literature. In

addition, the consensus problem of discrete-time high-order integral multi-agent systems is studied.

The corresponding consensus protocol and performance analysis are presented. Finally, three simulation

examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent years have witnessed a rapid development on the consensus or state agreement of

multi-agent systems due to its central role in distributed coordination tasks. Roughly speaking,

the consensus problem means that the states of all agents are convergent to a same value in

a distributed manner. In control community, considerable research efforts have been made to

address this problem from different aspects such as the dynamics of agent [1], [2], connectivity

of communication topology [3], and communication constraints [4], [5]. It is noted that for the

convenience of studying the last two aspects, most results assume that the agent is modeled by

the ï¬rst-order/second-order integral dynamics. However, due to the diversity of real-world agents,

these simple dynamics are insufï¬cient to fully describe the agentâs dynamical behavior. To ï¬ll

this gap, an intuitive way is to investigate the agent described by the high-order integral/general

linear time-invariant dynamics ï¬rst.

In the literature, consensus problems of high-order integral/linear multi-agent systems have

been addressed in [6]â[23], to name a few. Some early results are presented in [6] where a state-

feedback based consensus protocol is proposed for linear time-invariant multi-agent systems

under ï¬xed communication topology. Since the full state of linear agents may be unavailable in

some scenarios, several output-feedback based consensus protocols have been proposed as well,

for example, the static output-feedback based protocol [7] and the dynamic output-feedback based

protocols [8]. And the consensusability of linear multi-agent systems under these output-feedback

protocols is analyzed. In [9], [10], uncertainties in the dynamics of high-order integral/linear

agents are considered, and the consensus can still be achieved by employing the internal model

approach and the neural-network-based adaptive approach, respectively. An interesting leader-

following consensus protocol is proposed for linear multi-agent systems in [11]. Furthermore,

in [12], [13], the relationship between the consensus of high-order integral/linear multi-agent

systems and the synchronization in complex networks is discussed, and the concept of consensus

region is introduced. In addition, there are also some papers considering the consensus of high-

order integral/linear multi-agent systems with communication constraints such as communication

noises [14], communication delays [15], and quantization effect [16]. It is noted that all above

results assume that the multi-agent system works under ï¬xed communication topology. However,

in some applications of mobile agents, the creation and loss of communication links frequently

occur due to the sensorâs limited working region. Therefore, the study on the consensus of

high-order integral/linear multi-agent systems under switching topology is of more practical use.

Some attempts in this direction have been made in [17]â[23]. One common assumption of these

papers is that the topology needs to be undirected, which requires the bidirectional information

exchange between agents. Furthermore, in [17], the communication topology is required to be

âfrequently connectedâ rather than âjointly connectedâ. In [18]â[20], to design the control gain,

the eigenvalues of graph Laplacian matrix (a certain global information) should be known. In

[21], [22], the result is highly dependent on the doubly stochastic property of Laplacian matrix

of undirected graph. In [23], the consensus tracking problem of linear multi-agent systems under

switching topologies is investigated, however, all agents need to know the system matric in the

so-called exosystem which generates the tracking reference signal. It is also noted that consensus

of ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent systems with switching directed topology has been extensively

studied. The mildest connectivity condition on the switching directed topology seems âuniformly

jointly quasi-strongly connectedâ [24], [25]. Then a question arises consequently: is it possible

to obtain the counterpart result in the high-order integral/linear multi-agent systems?

This paper tries to give a positive answer to the above question. Two novel protocols, the

state-feedback based protocol and the output-feedback based protocol, are proposed to solve the

consensus problem of continuous-time high-order integral multi-agent systems. By the proposed

protocol, it is interesting to ï¬nd that the original high-order integral multi-agent system can be

transformed into a ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent system. And the convergence of the transformed

ï¬rst-order integral agentâs state implies the convergence of the high-order integral agentâs state if

and only if all roots of the polynomial, whose coefï¬cients are the entries of control gain vector

of the proposed protocol, are in the open left-half complex plane. Therefore, most results in the

ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent system can be generalized to the high-order integral multi-agent

system directly. Then it is proved that the connectivity condition on the consensus of high-

order integral multi-agents under switching directed topology is that the switching topology is

uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected. To the best of the authorsâ knowledge, it seems the

mildest connectivity condition in the literature of high-order integral multi-agent systems. In

addition, results obtained in the continuous-time domain can be extended to the discrete-time

domain as well. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated by three illustrative examples.

The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the problem formu-

lation and some preliminary results. Section III presents the consensus protocol for high-order

multi-agent systems in the continuous-time domain and gives the corresponding performance

analysis. Section IV extends the results in the continuous-time domain to the discrete-time

domain. Illustrative examples are provided in Section V. Section VI concludes this paper with

ï¬nal remarks.

II. PROBLEM FORMATION AND PRELIMINARIES

In the literature, the graph theory is commonly employed to describe the communication among

agents. Let G = {VG, EG} be a digraph where VG = {v1, Â· Â· Â· , vN } is the node set and EG â VGÃVG

is the edge set. The ith agent in the network is represented by the node vi. The edge eij starting

from vj to vi belongs to EG if and only if the ith agent can receive information from the jth agent.

In this paper, it is assumed that there is no self-edge in the graph, i.e., eii /â EG, i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N.

The neighbor set of the ith agent is deï¬ned as Ni = {vj â VG|eij â EG}. A directed path in G

is a sequence of distinct nodes vi1, vi2, Â· Â· Â· , vim such that eis+1is â EG, s = 1, Â· Â· Â· , m â 1. The

directed graph G is called strongly connected if for any two distinct nodes vi and vj there is a

directed path starting from vj to vi. A node is called a center/root if there are directed paths

starting from this node to any other nodes in VG. The directed graph G is called quasi-strongly

connected if G has at least one center node.

Due to the link failure and packet loss, the communication channel of multi-agent systems

is usually time-variant. Therefore, it is assumed in this paper that the communication topology

is modeled by a set of graphs GÏ(t) = {VG, EGÏ(t)}. Ï(Â·) : [0, â) â S is a piecewise constant
function whose value at time t is the index of the graph representing the agentâs communication

topology at time t. S denotes the index set of all possible graphs and S has ï¬nite elements

because the node set VG is a ï¬nite set. The following assumption is applied to the switching

signal Ï(Â·), which means that the communication topology does not change too fast.

Assumption 1: Let (t0, t1, Â· Â· Â· ) be the sequence of time points at which the piecewise constant

function Ï(t) switches. The dwell times Ïi = ti+1 âti (i = 0, 1, Â· Â· Â· ) have a uniform lower bound

ÏD > 0.

The union graph of GÏ(t) over the time interval [t1, t2) is deï¬ned as G[t1,t2) = (VG,

tâ[t1,t2) EGÏ(t)).

One concept on the connectivity of the union graph is given in the following.

S

Deï¬nition 1: GÏ(t) is said to be uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected if there exists a

constant T > 0 such that G[t,t+T ) is quasi-strongly connected for any t > 0.

The above section introduces the communication topology of the network of N agents. The

other essential part of modeling the multi-agent system is the agentâs dynamics. In this paper,

the dynamical behavior of each agent is described by the following m-dimensional high-order

integral dynamics

Ëxi,1(t) = xi,2(t),

Ëxi,mâ1(t) = xi,m(t),

The control objective is to solve the distributed consensus problem of this high-order integral

multi-agent system which is deï¬ned as follows.

Deï¬nition 2: The multi-agent system is said to reach a consensus if under certain protocol

ui(t), there exists a vector xâ â Rm such that

Before closing this section, the following result on the robust consensus of ï¬rst-order integral

multi-agents is provided [25].

Lemma 1: For the ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent system with external disturbances

Ëri(t) =

XjâNi(Ï(t))

Î±ij
Ï(t)(rj(t) â ri(t)) + Ïi(t),

i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N,

(3)

where ri(t) â R denotes the state of the ith ï¬rst-order integral agent, Ni(Ï(t)) denotes the
neighbor set of agent i at time t, Î±ij
Ï(t) > 0 is the weight constant associated with the edge
eij in graph GÏ(t), and Ïi(t) â R is the continuous disturbance signal. For âri(0) and âÏi(t)
satisfying suptâ[0,â) |Ïi(t)| < â and limtââ Ïi(t) = 0, then limtââ(ri(t) â rj(t)) = 0 if GÏ(t)
is uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected;

Proof: See the proof of Proposition 1 in [25].

III. CONSENSUS PROTOCOL AND RELATED ANALYSIS

A. State-Feedback Based Consensus Protocol

In this subsection, it is assumed that the full state information of each agent is available

for designing the consensus protocol. Inspired by the results presented in [14], the following

consensus protocol is proposed

ui(t) = K1xi(t) â

XjâNi(Ï(t))

Î±ij
Ï(t)K2(xi(t) â xj(t)),

(4)

where K1 = (0, âa1, âa2, Â· Â· Â· , âamâ1) â R1Ãm and K2 = (a1, a2, Â· Â· Â· , amâ1, 1) â R1Ãm. The
parameters (a1, Â· Â· Â· , amâ1) are constant control gains to be designed later. Î±ij
Ï(t) is deï¬ned in (3).

Substituting (4) into (1) obtains that

ËX(t) = (IN â (A + BK1) â LGÏ(t) â (BK2))X(t),

(5)

where X(t) = (xT

1 (t), Â· Â· Â· , xT
diagonal entry (i, i) of LGÏ(t) is
the graph GÏ(t).

P

N (t))T , the off-diagonal entry (i, j) of LGÏ(t) is âÎ±ij

Ï(t), and the
Ï(t). Here LGÏ(t) is called the Laplacian matrix of

jâNi(Ï(t)) Î±ij

October 9, 2018

DRAFT

Let Â¯X(t) = (IN â K2)X(t) â¡ (Â¯x1(t), Â· Â· Â· , Â¯xN (t))T â RN , then multiplying (IN â K2) at the

both sides of (5) obtains that

7

ËÂ¯X(t)= (IN â K2(A + BK1) â LGÏ(t) â (K2BK2))X(t)

= â(LGÏ(t) â (K2))X(t)

= â(LGÏ(t) â 1)(IN â K2)X(t) = âLGÏ(t)

Â¯X(t).

(6)

From (6), it is interesting to ï¬nd that under the proposed protocol, the original high-order

integral multi-agent system has been transformed into a ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent system.

Before proceeding with proving that Â¯xi(t) = K2xi(t) (i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N) can reach a consensus, we

should ï¬rst study whether the convergence of Â¯xi(t) implies the convergence of xi(t), which is

answered by the following lemma.

Lemma 2: Consider the following non-homogeneous linear differential equation

r(mâ1)(t) + amâ1r(mâ2)(t) + Â· Â· Â· + a2r(1)(t) + a1r(t) = f (t),

(7)

where r(t) â R and f (t) â R is a continuous function satisfying limtââ f (t) = f â. Let the
characteristic equation associated with (7) be

smâ1 + amâ1smâ2 + Â· Â· Â· a2s + a1 = 0.

(8)

Then, for any initial state (r(0), Â· Â· Â· , r(mâ2)(0)), (r(t), Â· Â· Â· , r(mâ2)(t)) are convergent if and only

if all roots of (8) are in the open left-half complex plane. In addition, lim
tââ

(r(t), r(1)(t), Â· Â· Â· , r(mâ2)(t)) =

(f â/a1, 0, Â· Â· Â· , 0).

Proof: See the proof in the Appendix.

Then the following main result can be obtained by Lemmas 1 and 2.

Theorem 1: The proposed protocol deï¬ned by (4) can solve the consensus problem of high-

order integral multi-agent systems if all roots of (8) are in the open left-half complex plane and

the communication topology GÏ(t) is uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected.

Proof: First, if GÏ(t) is uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected, by (6) and Lemma 1,

it follows that for âÂ¯xi(0), Â¯xj(0), limtââ(Â¯xi(t) â Â¯xj(t)) = 0, because Ïi(t) = 0 satisï¬es the

conditions required in Lemma 1.

Next, it is proved that there exists Â¯xâ such that limtââ Â¯xi(t) = Â¯xâ, i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N if and only if

limtââ(Â¯xi(t) â Â¯xj(t)) = 0, âi, j = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N. The sufï¬ciency is obvious. To prove the necessity,

October 9, 2018

8

let Â¯xmax(t) = max{Â¯x1(t), Â· Â· Â· , Â¯xN (t)} and Â¯xmin(t) = min{Â¯x1(t), Â· Â· Â· , Â¯xN (t)}. By (6), it follows
that ËÂ¯xmax(t) â¤ 0 and ËÂ¯xmin(t) â¥ 0, ât â¥ 0. This together with limtââ(Â¯xi(t) â Â¯xj(t)) = 0 lead to
that there exits Â¯xâ such that limtââ Â¯xi(t) = Â¯xâ, i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N.

If all roots of (8) are in the open left-half complex plane, it can be obtained by Lemma 2

that limtââ xi(t) = xâ, i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N where xâ = (Â¯xâ/a1, 0, Â· Â· Â· , 0)T , which means that the

proposed protocol can solve the consensus problem. In addition, âall roots of (8) are in the open

left-half complex planeâ is also necessary for solving the consensus problem by the necessity

proof of Lemma 2.

Remark 1: The most interesting feature of the consensus protocol deï¬ned by (4) is that under

the proposed protocol, the consensus problem of high-order integral multi-agent systems is

equivalent with the consensus problem of ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent systems. Therefore,

many existing results (for example, the consensus problem with delayed communication [26])

in the literature can be generalized to the high-order integral case directly.

Remark 2: The group decision value xâ is determined by two factors: the agentsâ initial states

and the communication topology GÏ(t). In the switching topology case, it is usually hard to give an
explicit solution to xâ. However, if GÏ(t) is balanced at any time (the graph GÏ(t) is called balanced
Â¯X(0). This

B. Output-Feedback Based Consensus Algorithm

In this subsection, it is assumed that the agentâs full state is not available any more. Instead,

only the agentâs output can be used for the consensus protocol design, which is modeled by the

following equation

yi(t) = Cxi(t),

(9)

where C = (c1, Â· Â· Â· , cm). Here it is assumed that the pair (A, C) is detectable.

Motivated by the dynamic output feedback consensus protocol proposed in [8], the following

protocol is proposed

Ï(t)K2(si(t) â sj(t)),

XjâNi(Ï(t))
Ësi(t) = (A + K3C)si(t) + Bui(t) â K3yi(t),

(10b)

DRAFT

where K1 and K2 are deï¬ned in (4), K3 â RmÃ1 is designed in such a way that A + K3C is
Hurwitz. The basic idea behind this protocol is that design an observer (10b) to dynamically

estimate the agentâs full state, and then use the estimated state to replace the actual state in (4),

9

which results in (10a).

By (2) and (10b), it follows that

d(xi(t) â si(t))/dt = (A + K3C)(xi(t) â si(t)).

Then

xi(t) = si(t) + exp((A + K3C)t)(xi(0) â si(0)).

(11)

Since A+K3C is Hurwitz, it can be proved that limtââ(xi(t)âsi(t)) = 0. Therefore, to prove

that xi(t) (i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N) can reach a consensus is equivalent to prove that si(t) (i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N)

can reach a consensus. Substituting (11) into (10b) obtains that

ËS(t) = (IN â (A + BK1) â LGÏ(t) â BK2)S(t)

â (IN â (K3C exp((A + K3C)t)))(X(0) â S(0)),

(12)

where S(t) = (sT

1 (t), Â· Â· Â· , sT

N (t))T and X(t) is deï¬ned in (5).

Similarly, let Â¯S(t) = (IN â K2)S(t) â¡ (Â¯s1(t), Â· Â· Â· , Â¯sN (t))T â RN , then multiplying (IN â K2)

at the both sides of (13) obtains that

ËÂ¯S(t) = â(IN â (K2K3C exp((A + K3C)t)))(X(0) â S(0))

â LGÏ(t)

Â¯S(t) â¡ âLGÏ(t)

Â¯S(t) + Â¯Ï(t),

(13)

where Â¯Ï(t) = (Â¯Ï1(t), Â· Â· Â· , Â¯ÏN (t))T and Â¯Ïi(t) = (K2K3C exp((A + K3C)t))(xi(0) â si(0)).

From (13), the original consensus problem has been transformed into the robust consensus

problem of ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent systems. Similar with the method employed in Theo-

rem 1, the following result shows that the output-feedback based consensus protocol deï¬ned by

(10) can also solve the consensus problem under the same conditions of Theorem 1.

Theorem 2: Assume that A + K3C is Hurwitz. The proposed protocol deï¬ned by (10) can

solve the consensus problem of high-order integral multi-agent systems if all roots of (8) are

in the open left-half complex plane and the communication topology GÏ(t) is uniformly jointly

quasi-strongly connected.

Proof: First, let Î¦ Â¯S(t, s) be the state transition matrix of (13). Due to Assumption 1, Î¦ Â¯S(t, s)

can be written as

Î¦ Â¯S(t, s) = exp(âLGÏ(tp)(t â tp)) exp(âLGÏ(tpâ1)(tp â tpâ1))

Ã Â· Â· Â· Ã exp(âLGÏ(tq )(tq+1 â s)), t â¥ s,

(14)

where tp is the largest time switching point smaller than t and tq is the largest time switching

point smaller than s. In [27], it has been proved that for any â â¥ 0, exp(âLGÏ(ti)â) is a stochastic
matrix. Then Î¦ Â¯S(t, s) is also a stochastic matrix. Therefore, kÎ¦ Â¯S(t, s)kF â¤ N 2, ât â¥ s.

If GÏ(t) is uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected, by the same analysis in the proof of
ËÂ¯S(t) =

Theorem 1, the solution to the homogeneous differential equation associated with (13),

Â¯S(t), is convergent under any initial states. Therefore, there exists a matrix Î¦â

Â¯S such that

âLGÏ(t)
limtââ Î¦ Â¯S(t, 0) = Î¦â
Â¯S.
The solution to (13) can be written as

Â¯S(t) = Î¦ Â¯S(t, 0) Â¯S(0) +

(15)

Next, let Âµ1, Â· Â· Â· , Âµm be the eigenvalues of A + K3C. Then Â¯Ïk(t) in (13) is the linear
combination of tjeÂµit, i, j = 1, Â· Â· Â· , m. Since the real parts of Âµ1, Â· Â· Â· , Âµm are all in the open
left-half complex plane, it can be proved that limtââ tjeÂµit = 0 and
tjeÂµitdt < â. Then

suptâ[0,â) |Ïk(t)| < â, limtââ Â¯Ïk(t) = 0 and
that

Since limtââ Â¯Ïk(t) = 0, k = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N, by Lemma 1, it follows that limtââ(Â¯si(t)â Â¯sj(t)) = 0
if GÏ(t) is uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected. This together with the convergence of Â¯S(t)
lead to that there exists Â¯sâ such that limtââ Â¯si(t) = Â¯sâ, i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N. Because A + K3C is

limtââ Â¯si(t) = Â¯sâ, âi = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N. If all roots of (8) are in the open left-half complex plane, by
Lemma 2, it can be obtained that limtââ xi(t) = (Â¯sâ/a1, 0, Â· Â· Â· , 0), i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N, which closes

the proof of this theorem.

C. General Linear Time-Invariant Multi-Agent Systems

Consider the multi-agent system composed of the following general continuous-time linear

time-invariant dynamical agent

Ëxi(t) = Agxi(t) + Bgui(t),

yi(t) = Cgxi(t),

i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N,

(17)

where xi(t) â Rm, Ag â RmÃm, Bg â Rm, and Cg â Rm (Cg is a row vector).

If the pair (Ag, Bg) is controllable and the pair (Ag, Cg) is detectable, by Luenberger control-

lable canonical, there exists a matrix Tg â RmÃm such that

Â¯Ag = TgAgT â1

Let ag = (a1

IV. EXTENSIONS TO DISCRETE-TIME HIGH-ORDER INTEGRAL MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS

The results obtained in the continuous-time domain can also be extended to the discrete-time

case. Assume that the ith agent is described by the following discrete-time high-order model

xi[k + 1] = Axi[k] + Bui[k],

yi[k] = Cxi[k],

(20a)

(20b)

DRAFT

where xi[k] = (xi,1[k], Â· Â· Â· , xi,m[k])T â Rm, ui[k] â R and yi[k] â R are the agentâs state, input
and output at the kth step, respectively. The system matrices A, B and C are deï¬ned same as

the ones in (2) and (9).

The dynamic-output feedback based consensus protocol is proposed as follows

ui[k] = K4zi[k] â

1 +

jâNi[Ï[k]] Î±ij

Ï[k] XjâNi[Ï[k]]

Î±ij
Ï[k]K5(zi[k] â zj[k]),

P
zi[k + 1] = (A + K6C)zi[k] + Bui[k] â K6yi[k],

(21a)

(21b)

where Ï[k] denotes the index of the graph representing the agentâs communication topology at the
kth step; GÏ[k], Ni[Ï[k]] and Î±ij
Ï[k] have the similar meanings as the ones deï¬ned in the continuous-
time case; K4 = (b1, b2 â b1, Â· Â· Â· , bmâ1 â bmâ2, 1 â bmâ1) â R1Ãm, K5 = (b1, b2, Â· Â· Â· , bmâ1, 1) â
R1Ãm and K6 â RmÃ1 is designed in such a way that all eigenvalues of A + K6C are in the
unit circle.

By (21b), it follows that

zi[k + 1] â xi[k + 1] = (A + K6C)(zi[k] â xi[k]),

which results in

zi[k] = (A + K6C)k(zi[0] â xi[0]) + xi[k].

(22)

(23)

Then substituting (21a) and (23) into (21b) obtains that

Z[k + 1] = (IN â (A + BK4))Z[k] â (S[k] â BK5)Z[k]

+ (IN â (K6C(A + K6C)k))(Z[0] â X[0]),

(24)

1 [k], Â· Â· Â· , zT
where Z[k] = (zT
and the (i, j)-entry (i 6= j) of S[k] is â(Î±ij

N [k])T , the (i, i)-entry of S[k] is (

Ï[k]).

Ï[k])/(1 +

jâNi[Ï[k]] Î±ij

Ï[k])

P

Similar with the continuous-time case, multiplying IN â K5 at both sides of (24) obtains that

P

Â¯Z[k + 1] = (IN â S[k]) Â¯Z[k] + Ïd[k],

(25)

where Ïd[k] â¡ (IN â (K5K6C(A + K6C)k))(Z[0] â X[0]), Â¯Z[k] â¡ (Â¯z1[k], Â· Â· Â· , Â¯zN [k])T and
Â¯zi[k] = K5zi[k] (i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N).

From (25), it can be seen that the original discrete-time high-order integral multi-agent system

has been transformed into a discrete-time ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent system with a vanishing

October 9, 2018

13

disturbance. Similar with the continuous-time case, in the following section, this reduced-order

multi-agent system is proved to reach a consensus ï¬rst, and then the consensus of the original

multi-agent system can be ensured provided certain condition is applied to (b1, Â· Â· Â· , bmâ1).

Lemma 3: The discrete-time ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent system deï¬ned by (25) can reach a

consensus if GÏ[k] is uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected in the discrete-time sense. (GÏ[k]

is called to be uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected in the discrete-time sense if there

exists a constant M > 0 such that the union graph (VG,

iâ{k,k+1,Â·Â·Â· ,k+M } EGÏ[i]) is quasi-strongly

connected for any k > 0.)

S

Proof: Let the state transition matrix of (25) be

jâ1

Î¦d(j, i) =

(IN â S[k]) âj > i, Î¦d(i, i) = IN .

(26)

Yk=i

It is easy to verify that âk = 0, 1, Â· Â· Â· , IN â S[k] is a stochastic matrix with positive diagonal

elements. Therefore, Î¦d(j, i) is also a stochastic matrix, which implies that kÎ¦d(j, i)kF < N 2,

âj â¥ i â¥ 0. Then the solution to (25) is

Â¯Z[k] = Î¦d(k, 0) Â¯Z[0] +

kâ1

Xi=0

Î¦d(k, i)Ïd[i].

(27)

Next, two mathematical operators are deï¬ned, which play a key role in analyzing the convergence
N
of Â¯Z[k]. For a stochastic matrix P = {Pij} â RN ÃN , deï¬ne Ï (P ) = 0.5 maxi,j
s=1 |Pis â Pjs|.
For a vector p = (p1, Â· Â· Â· , pN )T â RN , deï¬ne âp = maxi,j |pi â pj|. By [28], for any vector
r1 â RN and stochastic matrix P â RN ÃN , if r2 = P r1, then âr2 â¤ Ï (P )âr1. Therefore it can
be obtained that

P

kâ1

â Â¯Z[k] â¤ Ï (Î¦d(k, 0))â Â¯Z[0] +

Ï (Î¦d(k, i))âÏd[i].

(28)

Xi=0

By Lemma 3.9 in [24] and Theorem 3.1 in [29], the following properties hold for the state

transition matrix Î¦d(Â·, Â·). That is: if the communication topology GÏ[k] is uniformly jointly quasi-

strongly connected in the discrete-time sense, then

â¢ there exists a vector c â RN satisfying 1T

N c = 1 such that limtââ Î¦d(t, 0) = 1N cT ;

â¢ for any integers k, h â¥ 0, there exist CM > 0 and 0 < Î»Î¦ < 1 such that Ï (Î¦d(k + h, k)) â¤

CM Î»h
Î¦.

Let the maximal magnitude eigenvalue of A+K6C be Î»max. Since all eigenvalues of A+K6C

are in the unit circle, then |Î»max| < 1. And there must exist a constant Ce such that â(Ïd[k]) =

October 9, 2018

â((IN â (K5K6C(A + K6C)k))(Z[0] â X[0])) < Ce|Î»max|k. Therefore,

By the deï¬nition of the operator â, it follows that âk â¥ 0, â Â¯Z[k] â¥ 0. This together with (31)

leads to

lim

(Â¯zi[k] â Â¯zj[k]) = 0,

â1 â¤ i, j â¤ N.

(32)

Similar with Theorem 2, the convergence of Â¯Z[k] is proved in the following part. From one

side, since all eigenvalues of A + K3C are in the unit circle, it is easy to prove that there exists

a constant Md such that

â
i=0 kÏd[i]k2 < Md. Therefore, âÇ« > 0, there exists M1 > 0 such
kÏd[i]k2 < Ç«. From the other side, because of the convergence of Î¦d(k, 0), âÇ« > 0,

there exists M2 > M1 such that for any k1 â¥ k2 â¥ M2, kÎ¦d(k1, M1) â Î¦d(k2, M1)kF < Ç«. By
the above two facts, the convergence of Â¯Z(t) can also be proved by the Cauchyâs Convergence

Theorem. That is

i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N.

The next Lemma bridges the discrete-time ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent system and the orig-

inal high-order multi-agent system, which plays a same role as its continuous-time counterpart

(Lemma 2).

Lemma 4: Consider the following non-homogeneous linear difference equation

r[k + m â 1] + bmâ1r[k + m â 2] + Â· Â· Â· + b2r[k + 1] + b1r[k] = f [k],

(34)

where r[k] â R and f [k] is a convergent sequence satisfying limkââ f [k] = f â. Let the
characteristic equation associated with (7) be

smâ1 + bmâ1smâ2 + Â· Â· Â· b2s + b1 = 0.

(35)

Then, for any initial state (r[0], r[1], Â· Â· Â· , r[m â 2]), r[k] is convergent to f â/(b1 + Â· Â· Â·+ bmâ1 + 1)

if all roots of (35) are in the unit circle.

Proof: See the proof in the Appendix.

Theorem 3: Under the proposed consensus protocol deï¬ned by (21), the discrete-time high-

order multi-agent system deï¬ned by (20) can reach a consensus if the communication topology

GÏ[k] is uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected in the discrete-time sense, all eigenvalues of

A + K6C are in the unit circle and the control parameters (b1, Â· Â· Â· , bmâ1) in (21) are designed

in such a way that all roots of (35) are in the unit circle.

Proof: If GÏ[k] is uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected in the discrete-time sense, by
Lemma 3, there exists zâ â R such that limkââ Â¯Z[k] = zâ1N . Then by (23), limkââ Â¯Z[k] =

limkââ(IN â K5)X[k] since all eigenvalues of A + K6C are in the unit circle. Therefore,
limkââ K5xi[k] = zâ which implies that

Since all roots of (35) are in the unit circle, it follows by Lemma 4 that limkââ xi,1[k] = zâ.
Due to the relationship between xi,1[k], Â· Â· Â· , xi,m[k], it can be proved that limkââ xi[k] = zâ1N ,

J Â¨qi,2(t) â k(qi,1(t) â qi,2(t)) = Ïi(t),

(37)

where qi,1(t) denotes the angle of the robotic link; qi,2(t) represents the angle of actuator; I and

J denote the inertia of the actuator and robotic link, respectively; M is the mass of the robotic

link; L represents the length between the mass center and the joint mounting point; k denotes

the springâs torsion coefï¬cient; Ïi(t) is the torque input. The communication topology switches

between the following three cases (shown in Fig. 2). Ï(t) = mod (10t, 3) + 1. Then ât â¥ 0,

the union graph G[t,t+0.3) is quasi-strongly connected which means that GÏ(t) is uniformly jointly

Therefore, the consensus protocol ui(t) in (39) can be designed according to (4). K1 and K2

in (4) are set as K1 = (0, â1, â3, â3) and K2 = (1, 3, 3, 1). It is easy to verify that under

these control parameters, all roots of (7) are in the open left-half complex plane. By Theorem

1, the control objective can be achieved. In the simulation, the parameters in (37) are set as

follows: M = 1.5kg; g = 9.8m/s2; J = 3.2kgÂ·m2; I = 1kgÂ·m2; L = 0.8m; k = 2.5N/deg.

The initial joint conï¬guration is set as q1,1(0) = 2.5deg, q1,2(0) = 1.5deg, q2,1(0) = 1.9deg,

q2,2(0) = 3.14deg, q3,1(0) = â2.4deg, q3,2(0) = â2.6deg, q4,1(0) = 1.57deg, q4,2(0) = â1.5deg,

q5,1(0) = â3.14deg, q5,2(0) = 0deg and Ëqi,1(0) = Ëqi,2(0) = 0deg/s. The simulation results are

shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that limtââ qi,1(t) = â3.255deg and limtââ qi,2(t) = â2.723deg,

which means that the consensus problem is solved. Therefore, the correctness of Theorem 1 is

illustrated by this example. In addition, this example also shows that the consensus problem of

some nonlinear multi-agent systems can be solved by combining the proposed protocol and the

feedback linearization approach.

B. Example Two

This example studies the attitude consensus problem of a group of four aircrafts. The schematic

diagram of the aircraft is shown in Fig. 4. A simpliï¬ed dynamical model of the aircraft vertical

motion is introduced in [30]. That is

J Â¨Î±i + b ËÎ±i + (CZEl + CZW d)Î±i = CZElEi,

mÂ¨hi = (CZE + CZW )Î±i â CZEEi,

(41a)

(41b)

where hi denotes the aircraftâs attitude; Ei denotes the elevator rotation angle (control input); Î±i

denotes the rotation angle of the aircraft about its mass center CG; b is the friction coefï¬cient;

LW = CZW Î±i is the lifting force applied at the âcenter of liftâ CL; LE = CZE(Ei â Î±i) is the

aerodynamic force on the elevator; m is the aircraftâs mass and J is its moment of inertia about

CG. In [30], these parameters are set as J = 1, m = 1, b = 4, CZE = 1, CZW = 5, l = 3 and
d = 0.2. Let xi = (xi,1, xi,2, xi,3, xi,4)T = (Î±i, ËÎ±i, hi, Ëhi)T , then equation (41) can be written in

In this example, it is assumed that only the aircraftâs attitude hi can be measured, which means

that yi = Cgxi = hi with Cg = (0, 0, 1, 0) in (17). It is easy to verify that under these parameters,

the attitude dynamics of aircraft is controllable and observable. The switch signal Ï(t) of the
communication topology is Ï(t) = mod (10t, 4) + 1. And Î±ij
Gk = 1 if eji â Gk; otherwise

be reached if the parameters in (19) are selected as follows

K1 = (0, â1, â3, â3), K2 = (1, 3, 3, 1), K3 = (1/3, â2/3, â6, â7)T ,

In the simulation, four aircraftsâ initial states are x1(0) = (0, 0, 8000, 0)T , x1(0) = (0, 0, 6500, 0)T ,
x1(0) = (0, 0, 7000, 0)T , x1(0) = (0, 0, 5000, 0)T ; and the initial estimated states are s1(0) =
(0, 0, 10000, 0)T , s1(0) = (0, 0, 7000, 0)T , s1(0) = (0, 0, 6000, 0)T , s1(0) = (0, 0, 4000, 0)T . The

trajectory proï¬les of four aircraftsâ real states and estimated states are displayed in Fig. 6, which

implies that four aircraftsâ attitudes reach a consensus.

C. Example Three

To validate the theoretical analysis in Section IV, the consensus problem of a group of four

discrete-time high-order integral agents deï¬ned by (20) is studied. The parameters in (20) are set

as m = 4 and C = (1, 0, 0, 0). The switching communication topology is similar with the one in

Example Two (Ï[k] = mod (k, 4) + 1, k = 0, 1, Â· Â· Â· ). The control gain vectors in (21) are set

as K4 = (1/8, 5/8, 3/4, â1/2), K5 = (1/8, 3/4, 3/2, 1) and K6 = (â2, â3/2, â1/2, â1/16)T .

Then, all roots of (35) are in the unit circle. The initial states of four agents are randomly selected,

and the initial estimated states are set as 04. The trajectory proï¬les of xi,1[k] (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are

given in Fig. 7, which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed protocol deï¬ned by (21).

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper studies the consensus of high-order integral multi-agent systems under the switching

directed topology. The state-feedback based protocol and the dynamic output-feedback based pro-

tocol are proposed to solve the consensus problem, respectively. It is noted that by the proposed

approaches, the consensus of the high-order integral multi-agent system can be transformed into

the consensus of the ï¬rst-order integral multi-agent system if all roots of the polynomial (8) are

in the open left-half complex plane. By using results in the robust consensus, it is proved that

under both consensus protocols, the connectivity condition on the switching directed topology

is only âuniformly jointly quasi-strongly connectedâ, which is much weaker than the existing

conditions. Finally, it should be noted that one most interesting contribution of this paper is that

under the proposed protocols, there exists certain âequivalenceâ between the ï¬rst-order integral

multi-agent system and the high-order integral multi-agent system. Most results in the ï¬rst-order

integral multi-agent system can therefore be generalized to the high-order integral case, which

deserves more investigation in the future.

has the property that limtââ Rji(t) = 0. Then it can be obtained that whatever the coefï¬cients
