Abstract

This report studies the emergent behavior of systems of agents
performing cyclic pursuit controlled by an external broadcast signal
detected by a random set of the agents. Two types of cyclic pursuit are
analyzed: 1)linear cyclic pursuit, where each agent senses the relative
position of its target or leading agent 2)non-linear cyclic pursuit, where
the agents can sense only bearing to their leading agent and colliding
agents merge and continue on the path of the pursued agent (a so-
called âbugsâ model). Cyclic pursuit is, in both cases, a gathering
algorithm, which has been previously analyzed. The novelty of our
work is the derivation of emergent behaviours, in both linear and non-
linear cyclic pursuit, in the presence of an exogenous broadcast control
detected by a random subset of agents. We show that the emergent
behavior of the swarm depends on the type of cyclic pursuit. In the
linear case, the agents asymptotically align in the desired direction
and move with a common speed which is a proportional to the ratio
of the number of agents detecting the broadcast control to the total
number of agents in the swarm, for any magnitude of input (velocity)
In the non-linear case, the agents gather and move with a
signal.
shared velocity, which equals the input velocity signal, independently
of the number of agents detecting the broadcast signal.

Introduction

In this work we consider the behaviour of n agents performing cyclic pursuit,
when an exogenous velocity control is broadcast by a controller and detected
by a random set of agents. The cyclic pursuit problem is formulated as n
agents chasing each other. The agents are ordered from 1 to n, and agent i
acquires information about its leading agent (prey) i+1. The agent indices are
(modulo n) throughout this paper. The agents start from arbitrary positions
on a plane.

In graph theoretic terms, cyclic pursuit can be represented by a directed
cycle graph, whose nodes are the agents and the directed edges depict the
information ï¬ow, as shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Information ï¬ow in cyclic pursuit

In this work we consider two types of information possibly acquired by

the agents

1. Relative position to the chased âtargetâ agent

2. Bearing only information, i.e. direction to the target

Let pi(t) be the position of agent i at time t; pi(t) â R2. We assume the
agents to be identical, memory-less particles, modeled as single integrators.

6

1. In case of relative position information, the autonomous kinematics of

agent i can be expressed as

Ëpi(t) = k(pi+1(t) â pi(t); k > 0 i = (1, ...n)

(1)

In the sequel we assume, without loss of generality, k = 1. Itâs easy to
see that in this case (1) can be decoupled into

Ëxi(t) = xi+1(t) â xi(t)
Ëyi(t) = yi+1(t) â yi(t)

(2)
(3)

Thus, we can consider only the x coordinates and obtain results for
the y coordinates by similarity. Let X(t) = (x1(t), . . . , xn(t))T . Then,
from (2), we have

ËX(t) = M X(0)

Eq. (4) is a linear system, where M is the circulant matrix (5).

This system shall be referred to in the sequel as linear cyclic pursuit.

2. Bearing only information ï¬ow generates a non-linear cyclic pursuit. Let

di(t) be the distance between agents i and i + 1 at time t:

di(t) = â¥pi+1(t) â pi(t)â¥

(6)

where â¥.â¥ represents the Euclidean norm. Then, if di(t) â  0 the law of
bearing-only autonomous motion can be written as

Ëpi(t) = pi+1(t) â pi(t)

di(t)

where we assumed the speed of all agents to be 1. Moreover, we assume
that if di(Ët) = 0 at some time Ët, then pi(t) = pi+1(t) for all t â¥ Ët, i.e.
when agents i and i + 1 collide they merge and continue as one agent
in the direction of i + 1. This model is known in the literature as the
âbugsâ model, see e.g. [25], [14] and references therein .

The novelty of our work is the derivation of emergent behaviours, in
both linear and non-linear cyclic pursuit, in the presence of an exogenous
broadcast velocity signal detected by a random subset of agents. The impact
of the external velocity signal on the movement of agents in the linear case
is shown in section 2 and for the non-linear case in section 3.

1.1 Literature survey and our contribution

1.1.1 Linear cyclic pursuit

Autonomous linear cyclic pursuit, belongs to the larger class of networks
with directed, ï¬xed topology graphs, denoted by G, where each node applies
protocol (8)

Ëxi(t) = ui(t)
ui(t) = â
jâNi

aij(xj(t) â xi(t));

i â {1, . . . , n}

(7)
(8)

where Ni is the neighborhood of i, deï¬ned as Ni = {j â {1, . . . , n}: aij > 0}.
In our case Ni = {i + 1 mod(n)}, aij = 1âi and G is as depicted by Fig. 1.
Olfati-Saber, Fax and Murray show in [20], [21] that a network of integrators
with directed information ï¬ow, G, that is strongly connected, using Protocol
(8), yields the following results:

â¢ It globally asymptotically solves an agreement problem, i.e. xi(t â

â) = xj(t â â) = Î±; âi, j, [see Proposition 2 in [20])

â¢ A suï¬cient condition for Î± = Avg(x(0)), i.e. the agreement to be the

i=1 ui = 0.

average agreement, is ân
Note that if G is undirected and symmetric, i.e. aij = aji, then the
i=1 ui = 0 automatically holds and Avg(x(t)) is an invariant
condition ân
quantity, see [22]

â¢ G globally asymptotically solves the average-consensus problem using

Protocol (8) if and only if G is balanced.

Recalling that

â¢ A digraph is called strongly connected if for every pair of vertices there

is a directed path between them.

8

â¢ A node is called balanced if the total weight of edges entering the node

and leaving the same node are equal

â¢ If all nodes in the digraph are balanced then the digraph is called

balanced

We observe that the circular ï¬ow graph, depicted in Fig. 1, is strongly
i=1 ui = 0,

connected, balanced and, using ui(t) = xi+1(t) â xi(t), satisï¬es ân
the system described by 2, 3 solves the average consensus problem.

Addressing speciï¬cally the problem of linear cyclic pursuit, other re-
searchers derived similar results. Bruckstein et al., in [4], see Section âLinear
Insectsâ, showed that for every initial condition, the agents exponentially
converge to a single point, computable from the initial conditions of the
agents. Marshal, in [16] Section 2.2.6, oï¬ers an alternate proof for the same.
If the agents apply heterogeneous gains to the ui, i.e. ui(t) = ki(pi+1(t) â
pi(t)); ki > 0 âi, then the point of convergence of the agents can be controlled
by selecting these gains, as shown in [27]. Moreover, if convergence to a point
is achievable, then other formations are achievable by a simple modiï¬cation,
where each agent pursues a displaced version of the next agent, as discussed
in [15].

All of the above studies consider zero input or autonomous systems in
cyclic pursuit. Our main contribution is in the addition of an external broad-
cast control, detected by a random set of agents, and the derivation of the
asymptotic behaviour of the system in this case. Ren, Beard, and McLain,
in [24], consider the problem of dynamic consensus, which at ï¬rst glance is
similar to ours but is only a simple, special case, of our paradigm and results.
Applying their general graph case to the cyclic pursuit case, the update law
they apply is

Ëxi(t) = (xi+1(t) â xi(t)) + U (t)
i.e. a common input U (t) is applied at time t to all agents. They show
(Theorem 3) that in this case â¥x(t)âÎ¶(t)â¥ tâââââ 0, where Î¶(t) is the integral of
U (t) starting at the equilibrium point of the autonomous, zero input system.
Moore and Lucarelli, [19] consider the case where a separate input enters
each agent. However, they limit their analysis speciï¬cally the case where an
input enters only one node (or agent), say k. Moreover, the input is not a
general velocity control, as in our paradigm, but attraction of agent k to a

9

goal position, say xsp, i.e.

Ui(t) =

â§âªâª
â¨
âªâªâ©

(xsp â xi(t))
0 otherwise

if i = k

(9)

Dimarogonas, Gustavi et al. in [7], [9] also consider the global mission of con-
verging to a known destination point, but allow for multiple leaders. Leaders
are predesignated agents holding the information of the goal destination, thus
the external input in this case becomes

Ui(t) =

â§âªâª
â¨
âªâªâ©

(xsp â xi(t))
0 otherwise

if i â K

(10)

where K is the predesignated set of leaders. In [23], W. Ren extends the
problem of reaching a goal position to that of consensus to a time varying
reference state, and shows necessary and suï¬cient conditions under which
consensus is reached on the time-varying reference state. This is the problem
of tracking a time dependent state and not of steering by an external velocity
signal received by a random set of agents, as in our case.

In other works, the model is even further from our paradigm. Some
assume that the (predesignated) leaders have a ï¬xed state value and do not
in [12]
abide by the agreement protocol. For example, Jadbabaie et al.
consider Vicsekâs discrete model [28], and introduce a leader that moves
with a ï¬xed heading. Yet others add special agents to the swarm with
the purpose of controlling the collective behavior. In [10], [11] these special
agents are referred to as âshillsâ 1. The basic local rules of motion of the
existing agents in the system are not changed, however the shill does not
obey the same local rules but has a local control of its own, depending on
the states of the ordinary agents and a secret goal function.

We recall that in our paradigm the position of the agents is not known
to themselves and the leaders are are not special agents but regular agents,
randomly selected from the swarm, obeying the same gathering rule of motion
as the remaining agents. The external input is a velocity signal aimed at
steering the swarm in a desired direction and not a goal position for the
swarm. Thus our problem, as well as solution and results, is diï¬erent from
the above discussed cases, covered in the literature.

1Shill is a decoy who acts as an enthusiastic, internally driven agent, that looks like an

ordinary agent, having the goal to stimulate the participation of others

1.1.2 Cyclic pursuit with non-linear local control

Our paradigm for non-linear cyclic pursuit discussed herein, comprising sens-
ing direction to prey, chasing along the line of sight with unit speed and cap-
ture (merge) upon collision, is commonly referred to in the existing literature
as the bugs problem, also known as âantsâ, see e.g. [4], [3]. In [3] the conver-
gence of n ants in cyclic pursuit to an encounter point is proved. Richardson
In [4], Bruckstein
shows in [25] that the encounter occurs in ï¬nite time.
et. al extend the model allowing each bug (ant) to move at diï¬erent, time
dependent speed, vi(t). They show that integrability of the speed plays a
central role in the emerging behaviour of the swarm. Speed vi(t) is integrable
iï¬ the cumulative distance travelled by ant i at time t, Vi(t) = â«
vi(s)ds
holds Vi(â) < â. Constant speeds are not integrable, hence, according to
Theorem 1.ii in [4], the time of the last ant collision, i.e. termination time,
is ï¬nite.

t

The question of simultaneous mutual capture, i.e. the existence of a time
tc such that the distances di(tc) â â¥pi+1(tc) â pi(tc)â¥ = 0 and di(t) > 0 ât â
[t0, tc) for all i, was also investigated. In 1971 Klamkin and Newman, [14],
showed that if n = 3, the 3 bugs travel at the same speed and the initial po-
sitions of the bugs are not collinear, then the meeting of the three bugs must
be mutual, i.e. all bugs capture their prey simultaneously. Klamkin and
Newman speculate that this result generalizes to more bugs. In [2], Behroozi
and Gagnon prove that it does indeed generalize to n = 4 if the bugs initial
positions form a convex polygon. Only non-convex conï¬gurations can give
rise to a premature capture but a non-convex conï¬guration cannot evolve
from a convex conï¬guration. Behroozi and Gagnon in [2] generalize some
aspects of the proof for the n-bug systems but leave some open questions.
Thus, conditions for mutual capture for n-bug systems, n > 4, remain con-
jectures supported by simulations, see e.g.
[1]. Richardson shows in [25],
that, in the general case of n bugs in k dimensions, it is possible for bugs
to capture their prey without all bugs simultaneously doing so even for non-
collinear initial positions, however the probability of a non-mutual capture
occurrence is zero.

We note that the simple bugs model is not the only commonly used model
for non-linear cyclic pursuit. Another frequently used model for systems in
cyclic pursuit is based on higher order agent behaviour, like the unicycle
model, describing wheeled vehicles, subject to a single non-holonomic con-

11

straint, see e.g. [17], [8], [18], [6].

Our contribution is in deriving the emergent behaviour of the âbugsâ,
when an external controller broadcasts a velocity signal which is detected by
a random set of âbugsâ in the group. This problem has not been previously
investigated. [5] analyzes the problem of agents, modeled by single integrator
dynamic, in bearing-only cyclic pursuit with a moving target. The moving
target can be seen as a leader broadcasting velocity, but this leader is a special
purpose agent which does not participate in the cyclic pursuit. Moreover,
there is a basic assumption that all agents in cyclic pursuit detect targetâs
velocity and can sense the bearing to target. This model is entirely diï¬erent
from our paradigm where each agent can sense the bearing only to its leading
agent and the desired velocity is available only to a (random) subset of agents.

1.2 Paper outline and main results

The paper is organized as follows:

â¢ In section 2 we derive the emergent behaviour in case of linear cyclic
pursuit, with a broadcast steering control, using properties of linear
systems, and show that in this case the agents will asymptotically align
in the direction of Uc and move asymptotically as a time-independent
Uc, where nl is the number of agents
linear formation with velocity
detecting the steering control. In this case there is no restriction on
the size of â¥Ucâ¥.

nl
n

â¢ In section 3 we derive the emergent behaviour for the assumed non-
linear model (the bugs model with external input detected by a ran-
dom set of agents) and show that â¥Ucâ¥ within an upper bound ensures
convergence to a moving point. In this case, if at least one agent de-
tected the broadcast control, the agents will all move, after the mutual
capture time, as a single point with velocity Uc.

All the analytically derived results are illustrated by simulations.

2 Linear cyclic pursuit with broadcast con-

trol

In our paradigm, the equation of motion of agents performing linear cyclic
pursuit, i.e. sensing relative position to the chased agent, in the presence of
a broadcast velocity control, Uc, can be written as

Ëpi(t) = pi+1(t) â pi(t) + bi(t)Uc(t)

where

bi(t) =

â§âªâª
â¨
âªâªâ©

1 if agent i detected the external control
0 otherwise

(11)

(12)

Since pi = (xi, yi)T , and Uc(t) = (Ux(t), Uy(t))T , eq. (11) evolves indepen-
dently in the x and y directions, thus we can consider only one component,
say x. If we aggregate the x position component of all the agents we can
write

ËX(t) = M X(t) + B(t)Ux(t)

(13)

where

â¢ X = (x1, x2, ...., xn)T

â¢ M is the circulant matrix (14) representing the interactions graph of

agents in linear cyclic pursuit

â¢ B(t) is the leaders indicator vector at time t, i.e. the iâth entry in the

vector B(t) is bi(t) and bi(t) is deï¬ned by (12)

In eq. (13), M is time independent and if we assume B(t) and Ux(t)
to be piecewise constant, i.e. we assume that the time-line can be divided
into intervals, t â [tk, tk+1), where B(t) â= B(tk), and Ux(t) â= Ux(tk), tk is the
time of change of leaders or of the broadcast control. In the sequel we treat
each time interval, [tk, tk+1), separately. Thus, it is convenient to suppress
the subscript k. Moreover, it is convenient to denote by t the relative time

13

since the beginning of the interval (t = 0) and by x(0) the state of the system
at this time, by B the leaders indicator during the interval and by Ux the
exogenous control during the interval. In each time interval eq. (13) evolves
as a linear time independent system, which has the well known solution (cf.
[13])

x(t) = eM tx(0) + â«

We note that M deï¬ned by (14) is a normal matrix, (Appendix A.5),
therefore it is unitarily diagonizable, i.e. M = V ÎV â, where V is a unitary
matrix of eigenvectors, V â denotes the transpose of the complex conjugate
of V and Î is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

Remark: Due to the circulant structure of M , V is the DFT matrix
In particular, since M is the circulant matrix with c0 = â1, c1 = 1 and

ck = 0;

k = 2, 3, ..., n â 1 , we have (from Appendix C)

â¢ the eigenvalues of M can be written as

Î»k = Ïk â 1;

k = 0, ...., n â 1

(16)

where Ï â= eâ2Ïj/n

while the remaining eigenvalues, Î»k;

It is easily seen that Î»0 = 0, with a corresponding eigenvector v0 = 1â

n1n,
k = 1, ...., nâ1, have negative real part.
These features of M constitute the basis for the derivation of the emergent

behaviour of swarms in linear cyclic pursuit with broadcast control.

Following the methodology in [26], we write eq. (15) as

X(t) = x(h)(t) + x(u)(t)

(18)

where

â¢ x(h)(t) = eM tX(0) represents the zero input, homogeneous, solution

Thus, a homogeneous system of n agents performing linear cyclic pursuit
will asymptotically converge to a point, the centroid, determined by the
initial conditions, which is a well known result, see e.g.
[4]. However, the
derivation in this section introduces a methodology which will be useful in
the sequel.

and all the following properties of Î¾x hold also for Î¾y. Note that M depends
only on the number of agents, thus for a given number of agents and a
constant broadcast control, Uc, the deviations depend only on B, i.e. on the
agents detecting the broadcast control. Moreover, if all the agents receive
the broadcast control then there are no deviations, i.e. the agents converge
and move as a single point.

Lemma 2.2. A group of n agents performing linear cyclic pursuit, with all
agents receiving an exogenous velocity control Uc, will asymptotically move
as a single point with velocity Uc.

Proof. If all the agents receive the broadcast control then nl = n and B =

Illustration of linear cyclic pursuit - single interval

We illustrate the derived analytical results by 2 simulated examples. Both
examples assume six agents, starting from the same random positions, shown
in Fig. 2, but diï¬ering in the broadcast control and the set of agents detecting
it. Example1 and Example2 were run for 50 secs (500000 points, dt=0.0001).
This simulation time was long enough to obtain the analytically derived
asymptotic behaviour.

Illustration of linear cyclic pursuit - multiple in-
tervals

We recall that we assumed B(t) and Uc(t) to be piecewise constant, i.e.
B(t) â= B(tk), and Uc(t) â= Uc(tk), where tk is the time of change of the set
of ad-hoc leaders or of the broadcast control, and we treated separately each
time interval, [tk, tk+1). In the above sections we considered a single time
interval, where Uc and B are constant.

In this section we show, by simulation, the emergent behaviour over multi-
ple time intervals. We consider as before 6 agents, starting at initial positions
as illustrated in Fig. 2 but, starting with Uc(0) = (6, 3)T , we allow for dis-
crete changes in Uc every 10 secs. Uc(t) is shown in Fig. 11. In this example
the set of ad-hoc leaders is randomly selected at t = 0 and remains constant
afterwards, i.e. B(t) = B(0)ât.

The emergent trajectories are illustrated in Fig. 12.

Figure 11: Uc(t) proï¬le

25

Figure 12: Emerging trajectories with Uc(t) as in Fig. 11

Fig. 13 shows the agents velocities vs. analytically computed asymptotic
velocity of the linear formation emerging from a broadcast velocity signal as
shown in Fig. 11.

Figure 13: Emerging velocities vs computed formation velocity

26

We note that changes in the random set of ad-hoc leaders, within an
interval where Uc is constant, will aï¬ect the speed of the agents (if the number
of ad-hoc leaders changes) and also the arrangement of the agents within the
linear formation.

3 Non-linear cyclic pursuit

We assume the model for non-linear cyclic pursuit to be the âbugsâ model,
where agent i chases agent i + 1 (agent n chases agent 1) with constant,
common, speed along the line of sight, merges with it upon capture and the
two agents continue with velocity Ëpi+1. Upon capture, the number of agents
is reduced. Agent i is said to capture agent i + 1 if the distance between
them, di, is zero

di(t) = â¥pi+1(t) â pi(t)â¥
(30)
where pi(t) is the position of agent at time t and â¥.â¥ represents the Euclidean
norm.

In case of an external broadcast velocity control, upon capture, the merged
agent will be assumed to detect the broadcast velocity signal, if either one
or both of the merged agents detected the broadcast velocity signal.

We ï¬rst analyze the properties of the âbugsâ model, without external
broadcast velocity signal, and then derive the impact of the broadcast velocity
which is detected by a random set of agents.

3.1 âBugsâ model
Let di(t) be deï¬ned by eq. (30) and assume, without loss of generality, the
speed of all agents to be 1. Then, the pursuit is formally deï¬ned as follows:

if di(t) â  0

Ëpi(t) = pi+1(t) â pi(t)

di(t)

if di(Ët) = 0 pi(t) = pi+1(t) for all t â¥ Ët

(31)

(32)

Lemma 3.1. If di(t) â  0 for all i and the motion of each agent is represented
by (31), then

(a) di(t) is monotonically non-increasing for all i.

(b) There exists a ï¬nite time Tm such that di(Tm) = 0 for all i

Proof. In the sequel, for simplicity of notation, we omit explicit reference to
time t, whenever it is not confusing.

3.2 âBugsâ model with external input
Let Ki denote the set of k indices of Ki = {i â k, i â k + 1, . . . , i â 1}.
If
dj = 0 âj â Ki and di â  0 we say that the k agents in Ki collapsed into
agent i.

In order to analyze the motion of agent i performing bearing-only cyclic
pursuit when a velocity signal, Uc, is broadcast by an external controller
and detected by a random set of agents, we have to consider three diï¬erent
scenarios :

1. i is a free agent, i.e. di â  0 and Ki = {}

2. k agents labeled (i â k, i â k + 1, . . . , i â 1) have merged into i, i.e. di â  0

and dj = 0 âj â Ki

3. Agent i collapsed into agent j, i.e. dj â  0,

di = 0 and i â Kj

These cases are formalized by eqs. (37) - (38):

Ëpi =

â§âªâª

âªâªâ©

pi+1âpi
di
pi+1âpi

if di â  0 âj â Ki

where â stands for logical âorâ,

pi = pj âi â Kj

bi =

â§âªâª
â¨
âªâªâ©

1; if i â N l
0; otherwise

(37)

(38)

(39)

and N l is the set of agents that detected the broadcast control.

If di = 0 âi then

Ëpi = (â
âi

bi)Uc âi

Thus, once gathered, the agents will move as a single agent with velocity Uc,
if at least one of the agents detected the external control Uc.

In section 3.2.1, we show the impact of the exogenous velocity signal, Uc
on a single distance, di(t), deï¬ned by (30), when either i or i + 1, or both,
detect Uc. We derive the behaviour of di, in each case, as a function of â¥Ucâ¥
and the instantaneous geometry. Since the agents are mobile, the geometry
is time dependent. Therefore, we cannot deduce from di(t) instantaneously

30

decreasing that it will decrease for all t or that it will reach zero. In section
3.2.2 we derive an upper bound on â¥Ucâ¥ that ensures convergence to a point
i=1 di(Tm) = 0, independently of the instantaneous
in ï¬nite time, Tm, i.e. ân
geometries.

3.2.1 Single di behaviour
Let di > 0 âi. This is a valid assumption since subsequent to a collision
(capture) the system evolves as a cyclic pursuit with fewer agents. Thus,

Ëdi =

Ëpi = pi+1 â pi

+ biUc

(41)

di
The impact of Uc on any distance di > 0 can be separated into four cases:

1. Neither i nor i + 1 detected the signal Uc â bi = 0,

bi+1 = 0

2. Both i and i + 1 detected the signal Uc â bi = 1,

bi+1 = 1

3. i detected the signal Uc, but i + 1 did not â bi = 1,

4. i + 1 detected the signal Uc, but i did not â bi = 0,

bi+1 = 0

bi+1 = 1

Case 1: bi = 0,

bi+1 = 0 .

This case is identical to Lemma 3.1(a), Fig. 14, and therefore Ëdi = cos(Î¸)â

1 â¤ 0, independently of the broadcast Uc.

Case 2: bi = 1,

bi+1 = 1 .

In this case

Ëdi = â¨ Ëpi+1 â Ëpi, Ëpi â Ucâ©

= â¨( Ëpi+1 â Uc) â ( Ëpi â Uc), Ëpi â Ucâ©

Recalling that ( Ëpj â Uc) = pj+1 â pj

dj

Ëdi = cos(Î¸) â 1

31

where Î¸ is now the angle between Ëpi â Uc and Ëpi+1 â Uc, see Fig. 15. Thus, in
this case Ëdi â¤ 0 , for any Uc, same as case 1.

Figure 15: Uc detected by both i and i + 1

Case 3: bi = 1,

bi+1 = 0 .

In this case Ëpi+1 is not aï¬ected by Uc, as shown in Fig. 16, where we have

â¥ Ëpi â Ucâ¥ = 1, and â¥ Ëpi+1â¥ = 1.

where the angles Î¸, Î± are deï¬ned as in Fig. 16. In order to have Ëdi â¤ 0 we
must have ââ¥Ucâ¥ cos(Î±) â¤ 1 â cos(Î¸). Therefore, di will be non-increasing

3.2.2 Gathering in ï¬nite time

In section 3.2.1 we derived the instantaneous behaviour of a single inter-
agents distance when none or both or one of the limiting agents detected the
broadcast control. Since the geometry of the agents is time dependent we
cannot deduce the emergent behaviour of the system from the instantaneous
behaviour. Given that the agents behave according to the âbugsâ model with
broadcast control, see (37), we want to show that there exist conditions that
ensure the gathering of the agents to a moving point in ï¬nite time. These
conditions are derived in Theorem 3.2 as an upper bound on the magnitude
of Uc.

Theorem 3.2. If di is deï¬ned by (30) and di(t) â  0; i = 1, ..., n, then
(a) if â¥Ucâ¥ â¤ 1
2n2

, there exists a ï¬nite time Tm such that ân

i=1 di(t â¥ Tm) = 0

(b) (a) holds for all times when â di(t) â  0 even if di(t) = 0 for some i, i.e.

the capture is non-mutual

(c) Tm â¤ t0 + 2n â di(t0)

4.2 Examples of simulations results

In this section we show sample simulation results for various initial topolo-
gies, various external inputs and sets of ad-hoc leaders. All the presented
simulation results used n = 6.

4.2.1 Example1-bugs: Gathering property of the homogeneous

âbugsâ model

We show an example of gathering of the âbugsâ model, without external
input Let Example1-bugs denote the case of initial topology as in Fig. 18
and Uc = (0, 0).

38

Figure 18: Initial agents topology for Example1-bugs

Figure 19: Example1-bugs: Agents gathering in case of bearing-only cyclic
pursuit without external input

In Fig. 19, (xT max, yT max) denote the position of each agent, at the end
of the time interval. We see that the agents indeed converged to a point, but
this diï¬ers from the (displayed) initial centroid.

39

For comparison, we show the behaviour of the agents, starting from the
same initial conditions, but performing linear cyclic pursuit. The gathering
point in this case is the initial centroid.

Figure 20: Agents gathering in case of linear cyclic pursuit without external
input

4.2.2 Example2-bugs: Impact of external input and incomplete

sets of ad-hoc leaders

Next we show the impact of an external input, Uc, on the emergent behaviour,
for various values of Uc, such that â¥Ucâ¥ â¤ 1, and various incomplete sets of
agents detecting it. We show for each example the behaviour of di(t), the
distance of agent i to i + 1, âi, as well as agentsâ trajectories and velocities.
We observe that in all considered cases

â¢ There exists a time tc of mutual capture where di = 0 âi

â¢ For t â¥ tc all agents move as a single point with velocity Uc

â¢ The value of tc and the behaviour of distances to prey, di(t) for t < tc,
as well as of agentsâ velocities for t < tc depend on the value of the
external input and on the set of agents detecting the broadcast signal

40

All cases of Example2-bugs were run starting from the positions shown

in Fig. 21.

Figure 21: Initial agents positions for Example2-bugs

Cases considered were

â¢ Example2.1-bugs: Same broadcast signal, diï¬erent ad-hoc leaders

â Example2.1.1-bugs: Uc = (0.5, 0.3)T , B = (111011)T
â Example2.1.2-bugs: Uc = (0.5, 0.3)T , B = (001000)T

â¢ Example2.2-bugs: Same set of ad-hoc leaders, increasing magnitude

of broadcast signal

â Example2.2.1-bugs: B = (010010)T , Uc = (0.013, 0)T
â Example2.2.2-bugs: B = (010010)T , Uc = (0.5, 0.3)T
â Example2.2.3-bugs: B = (010010)T , Uc = (â1, 0)T

where B is a vector of pointers to the agents detecting the exogenous control.

4.2.3 Example3-bugs: Broadcast signal received by all

In this section we show that if the broadcast control is received by all then
the gathering property of the cyclic pursuit is independent of the value of
â¥U câ¥. We show simulation results for

â¢ Example3.1-bugs:Uc = (5, 3)T

â¢ Example3.2-bugs:Uc = (â3, 2)T

â¢ Example3.3-bugs: Uc = (0, 0)T

From the presented results we observe that the time to convergence is identi-
cal in all cases, i.e. identical to the case Uc = (0, 0)T . These results correspond
to the theory in section 3.2.1, case 2, where we show that if bi = bi+1 = 1 then
Ëdi is independent of Uc.

Remark 4.1. The broadcast signal being received by all is a particular case of
the broadcast signal being received by a random set of agents. Since we do
not enforce it, in order to enable the general case of a random, not complete,
set of agents receiving the broadcast signal we need to enforce â¥U câ¥ â¤ 1

A About matrices

Following [?], let Mn denote the class of all n Ã n matrices. Two matrices
A, B â Mn are similar, denoted by A â¼ B, if there exists an invertible (non-
singular) matrix S â Mn s.t. A = SBSâ1. Similar matrices are just diï¬erent
basis representation of a single linear transformation.Similar matrices have
the same characteristic polynomial, c.f. Theorem 1.3.3 in [?] and therefore
the same eigenvalues

A.1 Algebraic and geometric multiplicity of eigenval-

ues

Let Î» be an eigenvalue of an arbitrary matrix A â Mn with an associated
eigenvector v â Cn.
Deï¬nitions:

â¢ The spectrum of A â Mn is the set of all the eigenvalues of A, denoted

by Ï(A).

â¢ The spectral radius of A is Ï(A) = maxâ£Î»â£ â¶ Î» â Ï(A).

â¢ For a given Î» â Ï(A) , the set of all vectors v â Cn satisfying Av = Î»v
is called the eigenspace of A associated with the eigenvalue Î» . Every
nonzero element of this eigenspace is an eigenvector of A associated
with Î»

â¢ The algebraic multiplicity of Î» is its multiplicity as a root of the char-

acteristic polynomial det(Î»I â A)

â¢ The geometric multiplicity of Î» is the dimension of the eigenspace as-
sociated with Î», i.e. the number of linearly independent eigenvectors
associated with that eigenvalue.

â¢ We say that Î» is simple if its algebraic multiplicity is 1; it is semisimple

if its algebraic and geometric multiplicities are equal.

â¢ The algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue is larger than or equal to its

geometric multiplicity.

â¢ We say that A is defective if the geometric multiplicity of some eigen-

value is less than its algebraic multiplicity

58

A.2 Diagonizable matrices
Deï¬nition: If A â Mn is similar to a diagonal matrix, then A is said to be
diagonizable
Theorem 1. See Theorem 1.3.7 in [?].

The matrix A â Mn is diagonizable iï¬ there are n linearly indepen-
If

dent vectors, v(1), v(2), ...., v(n), each of which is an eigenvector of A.
v(1), v(2), ...., v(n) are linearly independent eigenvectors of A and S = [v(1), v(2), ...., v(n)]
then Sâ1AS is a diagonal matrix Î and the diagonal entries of Î are the
eigenvalues of A
Lemma 1. Let Î»1, ..., Î»k;
pose v(i) is an eigenvector associated with Î»i;
[v(1), v(2), ...., v(k)] are linearly independent.

k â¥ 2 be distinct eigenvalues of A â Mn and sup-
i = 1, ...., n. Then the vectors

Proof of Lemma 1.3.8 in [?]

Theorem 2. If A â Mn has n distinct eigenvalues, then A is diagonizable

Proof. Since all eigenvalues are distinct Lemma 1 ensures that the associated
eigenvectors are linearly independent and thus, according to Theorem 1, A
QED
is diagonizable

Notes:

1. Having distinct eigenvalues is suï¬cient for diagonizability, but not nec-

essary.

2. A matrix is diagonizable iï¬ it is non-defective, i.e. it has no eigenvalue
with geometric multiplicity strictly less than its algebraic multiplicity

A.3 Left eigenvectors
Deï¬nition: A non-zero vector y â Cn is a left eigenvector of A â Mn asso-
ciated with eigenvalue Î» of A if yâA = Î»yâ. From [?], Theorem 1.4.12, we
have the following relationship between left and right eigenvectors and the
multiplicities of the corresponding eigenvalue:
Theorem 3. Let Î» â C be an eigenvalue of A â Mn associated with right
eigenvector x and left eigenvector yâ. Then the following hold:

(a) If Î» has algebraic multiplicity 1, then yâx â  0

(b) If Î» has geometric multiplicity 1, then it has algebraic multiplicity 1 iï¬

yâx â  0

59

A.4 About non-symmetric real matrices

â¢ the eigenvalues of non-symmetric real n Ã n matrix are real or come in

complex conjugate pairs

â¢ the eigenvectors are not orthonormal in general and may not even span

an n-dimensional space

â Incomplete eigenvectors can occur only when there are degenerate
eigenvalues with algebraic multiplicity greater

eigenvalues, i.e.
than 1, but do not always occur in such cases

â Incomplete eigenvectors never occur for the class of normal ma-

trices

â¢ Diagonalization theorem: an n Ã n matrix A is diagonizable iï¬ A has n

linearly independent eigenvectors

A.5 Normal matrices
Deï¬nition 1. A matrix A â Mn is called normal if AâA = AAâ
Deï¬nition 2. A matrix A â Mn is called Hermitian if Aâ = A
Theorem 4. If A â Mn has eigenvalues Î»1, Î»2, ....., Î»n the following statements
are equivalent:

(a) A is normal

(b) A is unitarily diagonizable

(c) ân

i=1 ân
j=1

â£aijâ£2 = ân
j=1

â£Î»jâ£2

(d) There is an orthonormal set of n eigenvectors of A

Remark A.1. All normal matrices are diagonizable but not all diagonizable
matrices are normal.

A.6 Unitary matrices and unitary similarity
Unitary matrices, U â Mn, are non-singular matrices such that U â1 = U â, i.e
U âU = U U â = I. A real matrix U â Mn(R) is real orthogonal if U T U = I.
The following are equivalent:

60

(a) U is unitary

(b) U is non-singular and U â1 = U â

(c) U U â = I

(d) U â is unitary

(e) The columns of U are orthonormal

(f) The rows of U are orthonormal

(g) For all x â Cn,

â¥xâ¥2 = â¥U xâ¥2

Deï¬nition A.1. :

â¢ A is unitarily similar to B if there is a unitary matrix U s.t. A = U BU â

â¢ A is unitarily diagonizable if it is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix

B Laplacian representation of Graphs

Graphs provide natural abstraction for how information is shared between
agents in a network. Algebraic graph theory associate matrices, such as Adja-
cency and Laplacian, with graphs, cf. [?]. In this appendix some useful facts
from algebraic graph theory are presented. Given a multi-agent system, the
network can be represented by a directed or an undirected graph G = (V, E),
i = 1, ..., n representing the
where V is a ï¬nite set of vertices, labeled by i;
agents, and E is the set of edges, E â [V Ã V ], representing inter-agent infor-
mation exchange links.2 A simple graph contains no self-loops, namely there
is no edge from a node to itself. If the graph is undirected then the edge
set E contains unordered pairs of vertices. In directed graphs (digraphs) the
edges are ordered pairs of vertices. We say that the graph is connected if
for every pair of vertices in V there is a path with those vertices as its end
vertices. If this is not the case, the graph is called disconnected. We refer
to a connected graph as having one connected component. A disconnected
graph has more than one component.

2Vertices are also referred to as nodes and the two terms will be used interchangeably

61

B.1 Directed graphs - digraphs

A directed graph (or digraph), denoted by D = (V, E), is a graph whose edges
are ordered pairs of vertices. For the ordered pair (i, j) â E, when vertices
vi, vj are labelled i, j, i is said to be the tail of the edge, while j is its head.

Deï¬nitions:

1. A digraph is called strongly connected if for every pair of vertices there

is a directed path between them.

2. The digraph is called weakly connected if it is connected when viewed

as a graph, that is, a disoriented digraph.

3. A digraph has a rooted out-branching, or spanning tree, if there exists
a vertex r (the root) such that for every other vertex i â  r â N there is
a directed path from r to i. In this case, every i â  r â N is said to be
reachable from r. In strongly connected digraphs each node is a root.

4. A node is called balanced if the total weight of edges entering the node

and leaving the same node are equal

5. If all nodes in the digraph are balanced then the digraph is called

balanced

B.1.1 Properties of Laplacian matrices associated with digraphs

â¢ The non-symmetric Laplacian, L, associated with a digraph G of order

n has the following properties:

(a) L has at least one zero eigenvalue and all remaining eigenvalues

have positive real part

(b) L has a simple zero eigenvalue and all other eigenvalues have pos-
itive real part if and only if G has a directed spanning tree

(c) L is real, therefore any complex eigenvalues must occur in conju-

gate pairs3

3the eigenvalues of a real non-symmetric matrix may include real values, but may also

include pairs of complex conjugate values

62

(d) There is a right eigenvector of ones, 1n, associated with the zero

eigenvalue, i.e. L1n = 0n

(e) The left eigenvector of L corresponding to Î» = 0, denoted by wl is

positive and ân

i=1 wl(i) = 1,

(f) wl = 1T

n if and only if the digraph is balanced

â¢ If the Laplacian L of the digraph is a normal, i.e. LLT = LT L, then

1. There exists an orthonormal set of n eigenvectors of L
2. L is unitarily diagonizable, i.e. L = U ÎU â, where U is a unitary
matrix of eigenvectors and Î is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

3. The digraph must be balanced and thus wl = 1T
n

Every n Ã n circulant matrix C has eigenvectors (cf. [?], [?])

D Proof of mutual capture existence in ï¬nite
time, in non-linear cyclic pursuit without
broadcast control - Lemma 1.1 in [25]

This proof, sketched in [25], is brought here for completeness. Let pi(t)
be the position of agent i at time t and let agent i chase i + 1, where i is
mod n. Denote by di(t) is the distance between i to i + 1 at time t, i.e.
di(t) = â¥pi+1(t) â pi(t)â¥.

64

The dynamics of the agents are modeled by

Ëpi = pi+1(t)âpi(t)
pi(t) = pi+1(t) ât â¥ Ët

di(t)

if di(t) > 0

s.t. di(Ët) = 0

(61)

In the sequel, for simplicity, we shall omit speciï¬c mention of t, whenever

self explanatory.

Lemma D.1. n agents in cyclic pursuit, modelled by (61), will collide
i=1 di(t0), where di(t0)
(gather) within a ï¬nite time given by Tm â¤ t0 + 2n ân
are the initial distances between agents and Tm is the time of mutual capture
(termination time).

Proof. We show that there exists a time Tm such that di(Tm) = 0 for all i or,
since di > 0 for all i

n

i=1

di(Tm) = 0

(62)

To show (62) we will show that there exists a positive real number c > 0 such
that ân
i=1

Ëdi(t â¤ Tm) â¤ âc.

We assume that no agents have collided at time t < Tm. Note that upon
our model, when two agents collide they become one and n is reduced, there-
fore this assumption holds. Given eq. (61) we have

ËpT
