# Proposal: Evaluation and Comparison of AI-Generated Blog Posts

## Introduction

This project involves generating 200 blog posts from 200 summaries of arXiv papers using multiple LLMs. To evaluate and compare these outputs, we will deploy a systematic, metric-based approach to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the quality and differences across the models. This plan outlines two pipelines: one for evaluating individual outputs and another for comparing models based on these evaluations.

## Pipeline 1: Evaluating Outputs Across Various Models

### Objective
Evaluate the quality of each model's output using a set of specific academic writing metrics.

### Steps and Metrics

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather outputs generated by different models from the same arXiv summaries.
   - Store each output in a structured format.

2. **Metrics Calculation:**

   - **Text Similarity Metrics:**
     - **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the similarity between text embeddings, helping us understand how closely the generated text aligns with reference summaries.
     - **BLEU Score:** Evaluates the overlap of n-grams between the generated text and reference summaries, indicating the precision of text reproduction.

   - **Readability Scores:**
     - **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL):** Assesses the readability of the text, giving insights into its complexity and suitability for different audience levels.
     - **Gunning Fog Index (GFI):** Another readability metric focusing on sentence length and complexity, ensuring the text is accessible.

   - **Content Coherence:**
     - **Entity Grid Models:** Analyze entity transitions to assess the logical flow and coherence of the text.
     - **BARTScore:** Uses a sequence-to-sequence model to evaluate coherence and fluency of the text by comparing generated text against reference texts.

   - **Lexical Diversity:**
     - **Type-Token Ratio (TTR):** Measures the variety of vocabulary used, indicating the richness of language.
     - **Shannon Entropy:** Assesses the unpredictability and diversity of word usage.

   - **Style Analysis:**
     - **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Analyzes syntactic structure to understand the distribution of different parts of speech and overall writing style.

   - **Groundedness and Fact-Checking:**
     - **Groundedness Score:** Evaluates how well the generated text aligns with the source documents, ensuring factual correctness.

   - **Argumentative Quality (specific to academic writing):**
     - **ArguGPT Metrics:** Analyzes the structure and quality of arguments, focusing on coherence, persuasiveness, and logical flow.

3. **DataFrame Creation:**
   - Create a DataFrame where each row represents an individual output (e.g., `summary_1`, `summary_2`).
   - Each column will represent the scores for each metric across different models.

**Example DataFrame Structure:**

| Summary   | Model 1 Cosine | Model 1 BLEU | Model 1 FKGL | Model 1 GFI | ... | Model 2 Cosine | Model 2 BLEU | Model 2 FKGL | Model 2 GFI | ... |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----|
| summary_1 | 0.85           | 0.75         | 12.3         | 15.2        | ... | 0.80           | 0.78         | 13.0         | 16.1        | ... |
| summary_2 | 0.88           | 0.70         | 11.8         | 14.5        | ... | 0.85           | 0.72         | 12.5         | 15.8        | ... |
| ...       | ...            | ...          | ...          | ...         | ... | ...            | ...          | ...          | ...         | ... |

## Pipeline 2: Comparing Models Based on Collective Evaluations

### Objective
Compare and rank models based on their performance across all evaluation metrics.

### Steps

1. **Aggregate Scores:**
   - Aggregate scores for each metric across all summaries for each model.
   - Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for each metric.

2. **Composite Scoring:**
   - Create a composite score for each model by combining all metric scores.
   - Use weighted averages if certain metrics are deemed more important.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Perform statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests) to determine if differences between models are statistically significant.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Generate visualizations (e.g., box plots, radar charts) to compare model performances.
   - Use `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for plotting.

**Example Visualization:**
- **Box Plots:** Compare the distribution of readability scores across models.
- **Radar Charts:** Display the performance of each model across multiple metrics.

## Integration into a Cohesive Pipeline

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Collect and organize outputs.
   - Preprocess text data for analysis.

2. **Metrics Calculation and DataFrame Creation:**
   - Implement the evaluation methods and populate the DataFrame.
   - Ensure consistent formatting and handling of missing values.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Aggregate and analyze the data.
   - Generate comparative visualizations and reports.

## Conclusion

By structuring our evaluation and comparison process into these two distinct pipelines, we can systematically assess the quality of outputs from various models and effectively compare their performances. This approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation using metrics relevant to academic writing and prepares the data for clear presentation in a group setting.

### Next Steps
- Finalize the metrics and methods for implementation.
- Begin data collection and preprocessing.
- Implement the evaluation pipeline.
- Aggregate results and perform comparative analysis.

This plan provides a robust framework for evaluating and comparing AI-generated outputs, ensuring a thorough and systematic approach that aligns with our academic writing standards.
