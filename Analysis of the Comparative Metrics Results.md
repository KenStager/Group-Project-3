35 Blog from Summary to 4o Blog from Summary
   1. exact_match_ratio: 0.634715
   2. cosine_similarity: 0.881723
   3. topic_overlap: 0.615833
   4. key_phrase_overlap: 0.634715
   5. semantic_similarity: 0.976759
   6. readability_difference: 2.014
   7. sentence_length_difference: 2.590258


Key Takeaways:
* High cosine similarity (0.881723) and semantic similarity (0.976759) indicate that despite being generated by different models (GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o), the blogs are quite similar in content and meaning.
* Moderate exact match ratio (0.634715) and topic overlap (0.615833) suggest that while there is a good degree of textual and topical overlap, there are still some differences.
* Positive readability difference (2.014) implies that blogs generated by GPT-4o are easier to read than those by GPT-3.5 Turbo.
* Positive sentence length difference (2.590258) shows that GPT-4o generates slightly longer sentences on average.






Raw Text to 4o Blog
   1. exact_match_ratio: 0.156197
   2. cosine_similarity: 0.772687
   3. topic_overlap: 0.416667
   4. key_phrase_overlap: 0.156197
   5. semantic_similarity: 0.923666
   6. readability_difference: -3.856
   7. sentence_length_difference: 18.769903


Key Takeaways:
* Low exact match ratio (0.156197) and key phrase overlap (0.156197) suggest significant differences in wording and phrasing between the raw texts and generated blogs.
* Moderate cosine similarity (0.772687) and topic overlap (0.416667) indicate some level of similarity in overall content but with notable differences.
* High semantic similarity (0.923666) shows that the meaning is still largely preserved in the generated blogs.
* Negative readability difference (-3.856) implies that raw texts are more complex and harder to read compared to the generated blogs.
* Large positive sentence length difference (18.769903) indicates that raw texts have much longer sentences on average.






Summary to 35 Blog
   1. exact_match_ratio: 0.700610
   2. cosine_similarity: 0.922533
   3. topic_overlap: 0.715000
   4. key_phrase_overlap: 0.700610
   5. semantic_similarity: 0.988961
   6. readability_difference: -0.240
   7. sentence_length_difference: 2.668679


Key Takeaways:
* High exact match ratio (0.700610), cosine similarity (0.922533), and semantic similarity (0.988961) indicate a strong similarity in content and meaning between summaries and blogs generated by GPT-3.5 Turbo.
* High topic overlap (0.715000) and key phrase overlap (0.700610) suggest that key topics and phrases from the summaries are well-represented in the blogs.
* Slight negative readability difference (-0.240) shows that the readability of the summaries and blogs is quite similar, with summaries being marginally easier to read.
* Positive sentence length difference (2.668679) indicates that the blogs have slightly longer sentences than the summaries.






Summary to 4o Blog
   1. exact_match_ratio: 0.785568
   2. cosine_similarity: 0.902882
   3. topic_overlap: 0.730833
   4. key_phrase_overlap: 0.785568
   5. semantic_similarity: 0.981576
   6. readability_difference: 1.774
